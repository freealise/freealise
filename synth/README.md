polyphonic theremin with camera and opencv (latency ?):  
use as feedback for spectrogram drawing on paper, or voice with formant filters  
AM and comb filters of synchronized frequency (delays) or convolver for spectrum  
  
compose phonetically with spectrogram (2 formants; formants are notes, vertical lines are noise between them)  
Vowels and rhythm with consonants and stresses (diphtongs as legato) are an additional tune (vowels as chords, consonants as beats)

formants <-> chord by octave transposition (are similar by sound, not only visually on different scales)  

harmonic ruler as stencil - count on calculator and draw  
marks on ruler from highest, collapse to one octave only  
(72 or 144mm - wallpaper in coat package), lower highlighted as bolder  
  
keyboard | MIDI in: key is frequency, pressure or row (+shift) is volume change  
  
  
[Speech has rhythm and melody of semantic stress that music and lyrics follow.  
Also follows story level of drama or emotion of speech by variation amplitude (value shift) or images expressed by sound if instrumental, each track in a record is the dynamics of more than one value. 
Record tracks resemble formants when base frequencies are heard and recognized by the brain (unlike on the image). 
You don't speak in equal temperament and more likely (although human speech data will not have precise intonation) use natural melodic intervals (?).]
