compose phonetically with spectrogram (2 formants; vertical lines are noise at the beginning of notes, and consonants)

formants <-> chord by octave transposition (are similar by sound, not only visually on different scales)  

harmonic ruler as stencil - count on calculator and draw  
marks on ruler from highest, collapse to one octave only

[Speech has rhythm and melody of semantic stress that music and lyrics follow.  
Also follows story level of drama or emotion of speech by variation amplitude (value shift) or images expressed by sound if instrumental, each track in a record is the dynamics of more than one value. 
Record tracks resemble formants when base frequencies are heard and recognized by the brain (unlike on the image). 
You don't speak in equal temperament and more likely (although human speech data will not have precise intonation) use natural melodic intervals (?).]
