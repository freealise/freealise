[language from 1992, product idea from 2002, brand story from 2011, current business]
(British influence) English is not my native language, but I started to learn it before school - and music has later become an important part of education.  
The brand Freealise refers to the sponsorship pricing model, it is an altered version of an early name of Linux (which was Freax),
influenced by the Occupy Wall Street movement (antonym of 'occupy').
