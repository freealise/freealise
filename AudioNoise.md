  
Would suggest to use a large foot-operated trackball mouse along with the pedal - this would let you control the sound in up to 3 dimensions, almost like a violin bow or voice.  
y: volume, x: pitch, z: am  
  
(I'd make a formant filter, even with consonants - just to learn C.  
 y: f2, x: f1, z: sibilance or sonority)
