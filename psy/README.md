business matchmaker (~Jewish), dating for social entrepreneurs where you swipe on ideas  
  
  
How to switch the 'editor' mode on and off without alcohol ?  
People can speak with improved fluency under hypnosis (that's what Jesus did when subjectively turning water to wine and making people act drunk)  
(Do what Abulafia did)  
  
Abulafia deliberately confuses himself (his animal soul) by physical and linguistic means as exercise for natural confusion of any kind (spiritual or mundane) so it is useful for prayer and as a step to prophecy - Jewish 'shaman' like Miriam  
  
ideograms -> formants -> phonemes -> syllables -> morphemes -> words -> phrases -> sentences -> story  
  
what AI (a golem) does is permute letters and phonemes to arrive at an idea  
only initially it gets data in an ordered way with an index, then recombines it (= Zohar)  
  
  
when did I reject Metatron ?  
Enoch -> Metatron, therefore Metatron has freedom of will  
Metatron is a benevolent ghost (spirit) of a tzaddik (opposite of dybbuk)  
magicians are seen as dybbuks after death, while their actual soul passes on  
  
obsession with external drugs or technology to induce mystical experience in ignorance of natural capacity of any human for this  
  
the key to avoiding singularity is spiritual development, not 'creativity' at which robots already excel greater than any people  
  
hobby mindset = doing without becoming (not doing without pay)  
  
  
(dancing syncs the brainwaves ~music, improves memory, imaging, fluency, _)  
stand on one foot for exercise; use the left and right side of brain and body at the same time (cross-crawl dance, outdoor activities, traditional crafts, design or natural puzzles)  
  
  
Jews don't habitually (only affectively) prostrate in prayer because it may induce sleepiness, although it is allowed  
  
  
Controlled breathing can induce sleep or increased wakefulness as a change in the brainwave patterns, for which a conscious change in breathing amplitude, frequency and phase is required, possibly along with synchronized musical or physical activity

and sensory deprivation (~mikveh or hammock or mattress, tallit or paper bag on the head, eye mask or kippah on the face, ear blockers, darkness - or the Dead Sea at night of new moon).

Phosphene observation — paying relaxed attention to the colored blurbs before closed eyes may help to transform them into images.  
Direct self-hypnosis - One may try to say again and again “_!” This will result in tiredness and some images may appear.  
Mind-machine visual stimulation - projected white noise.  
Audible white or gray noise, randomly generated algorithmic music.  
WearOS sleep tracking - may induce phases of sleep by audio or tactile feedback.  
Low doses of melatonin are usually sufficient to produce a hypnotic effect in most people. Higher doses do not appear to result in a stronger effect but instead appear to cause drowsiness for a longer period of time.  
  
Wort with the tea, not in the evening  
  
DMT is released in the body all the time and is required for normal brain functioning, only the amount is strongly affected by stress (mostly physical) through the change in breathing, and density of air related to height (~bike uphill).  
DMT significantly decreases the power of alpha (8-12 Hz) oscillations throughout all scalp locations, while simultaneously increasing power of delta (1-4 Hz), theta (4-7 Hz) and gamma (30-40 Hz) oscillations, as well as brain connectivity - which explains the similarity of effects to those of sensory deprivation.

candle and no electric light | electronics (darkness; sensory deprivation ?) -> melatonin (biphasic night sleep ? both Jews and Muslims wake up to pray)  
  
  
"In all my techniques, almost all, there is a confusion". – Milton H. Erickson
(unless confusion is the problem)

1. Indirect language with embedded commands ('British English') - L
2. Introducing ambiguity (freedom of choice and thinking) - W
3. Using metaphors and storytelling (everyman or indirect reference, story develops before it's interpreted) while matching the experience (presupposition, realistic you-character) - E
4. Utilization (constructive trolling) - P
  
Motivation: Darwin - survival, Freud - pleasure, Adler - power, Jung - self-actualization; Frankl - the combination of them forms meaning
