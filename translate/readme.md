! 'decoding' down to the morphemes (unit of meaning) is only the way to learn a language relatively similar to English as the association has to continue on the word level  
(use AI for the rest)  
words of phrases in the native language that sound like the given vocabulary, even not related to it by meaning or etymology,  
can still serve as mnemonic devices (= rebus; most of all when the words to learn are abstract with no specific imagery -  
although conventional imagery like commonly accepted pictograms may also assist with these)  
to find soundalikes in the dictionary (might not be the one that sounds most like it but is related), compose a rebus and relate it to the original word by meaning is an exercise for the learner  

add etymology and relations of word root between languages  
group words and morphemes by root and sound instead of subject
add stress pattern
