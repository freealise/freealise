! 'decoding' down to the morphemes (unit of meaning) is only the way to learn a language relatively similar to English as the association has to continue on the word level  
(use AI for the rest)  
words of phrases in the native language that sound like the given vocabulary, even not related to it by meaning or etymology,  
can still serve as mnemonic devices (= rebus; most of all when the words to learn are abstract with no specific imagery -  
although conventional imagery like commonly accepted pictograms may also assist with these)  
to find soundalikes in the phonetic dictionary (option for search with nearby phoneme substitutes; might not be the one that sounds most like it but is related), compose a rebus and relate it to the original word by meaning is an exercise for the learner

Hello!
I am looking forward to taking your course, only unfortunately I'm not eligible now for immigration to Sweden for lack of evidence of positive business experience or a CV convincing to employers.
Instead I am going to Georgia (country) to buy real estate and start a workshop that will hopefully promote English - while as a teacher of it I'd be so boring that even adults are going to fall asleep.

The decoding method has a limitation of being applied to grammar but not vocabulary, as the similarity between languages doesn't have to extend to words and morphemes (Georgian is an isolate).
Still the given words may sound like those in the native language of the learner, even if not related by meaning at all - which can be a funny way to remember them when no other clues are available :)

Sincerely,
