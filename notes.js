  (asylum - Greek visa -> CZ; $100,000 passport) ...cutting all ties with russia is the only path open to companies that wish to build their business or raise investments in the U.S. and Europe... In itself, a Russian passport is not a red flag. However, to work normally in Europe, neither start-ups nor their investors can afford to maintain operations in Russia. That means no staff and _no investors_... For example, the mere presence of vacancies tagged to “Russia” or “Moscow” on LinkedIn will immediately cause problems... It is also important to make a public statement about the company’s position on the war, the source added. https://www.unhcr.org/ua/en/stateless-persons
