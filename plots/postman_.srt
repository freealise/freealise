<i>All talk, all the time.</i>

<i>Bringing you sports and weather</i>

3
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:25,100
<i>Church leaders blame the rise of hate</i>
<i>crimes and racially-motivated attacks...</i>

4
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:28,140
<i>...on a militia-like group</i>
<i>calling themselves "The Holnists."</i>

5
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,700
<i>One of the most radical and powerful</i>
<i>of these groups...</i>

6
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:34,220
<i>...claims as its founder, the famed</i>
<i>motivational speaker, Nathan Holn.</i>

7
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:56,980
<i>The last of the great cities died</i>
<i>when my father was a child...</i>

8
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:59,670
<i>...victims of yet another war.</i>

9
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:02,390
<i>He told of the plagues that followed...</i>

10
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,620
<i>...and how the living hid themselves,</i>
<i>scattered in tiny hamlets...</i>

11
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:08,560
<i>...in hopes of surviving</i>
<i>whatever new madness...</i>

12
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:11,460
<i>...conspired to rob them</i>
<i>of the little that remained.</i>

13
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,300
<i>In those days, he walked alone...</i>

14
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:18,220
<i>...a solitary witness</i>
<i>to the chaos that reigned.</i>

15
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:22,700
<i>The earth itself had fallen victim</i>
<i>to the insanity.</i>

16
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,260
<i>He told stories of the 3-year winter...</i>

17
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,260
<i>...and how the dirty snow</i>
<i>never stopped falling.</i>

18
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:32,460
<i>He saw the ocean,</i>
<i>barren, poisoned, near death.</i>

19
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,820
<i>And how they watched the sky</i>
<i>for 16 long years...</i>

20
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:38,950
<i>...praying for the great lungs</i>
<i>to start working again.</i>

21
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:43,980
<i>He said it was as if the ocean</i>
<i>had breathed a great sigh of relief.</i>

22
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,390
<i>Many commuters</i>
<i>are abandoning their vehicles.</i>

23
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,580
Goddamn it, Bill!

24
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,020
You know I need to check it first.

25
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,300
I don't know.

26
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,500
Better than turpentine, Bill.

27
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,020
Tastes about the same.

28
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,190
What do you say?

29
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,660
Your call.

30
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,710
Hm?

31
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:32,820
You ain't picky, Bill.

32
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,070
I like that about you.

33
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,910
Things I like about my ass...

34
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:44,140
...number 1:

35
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,510
Will settle for turpentine.

36
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:54,620
Hey, Bill! We got TV!

37
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,780
We got 147 channels, Bill.

38
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,310
We got everything from...

39
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:09,980
...Jesus to Jeopardy.

40
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,950
Like...

41
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:16,265
...sands through the hourglass,
so are the days...

42
00:05:16,365 --> 00:05:17,460
We'll watch that.

43
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,945
<i>...sands through the hourglass,</i>
<i>so are the days of our lives.</i>

44
00:05:21,045 --> 00:05:22,310
Monday.

45
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:26,455
Monday night.

46
00:05:26,555 --> 00:05:27,900
<i>Monday Night Football.</i>

47
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,940
All right, I don't want any trouble.

48
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:41,750
I bet you don't either.

49
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:46,470
Let's just call it a draw.

50
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,550
I'm rich!

51
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,060
I know the rule.

52
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,940
It's my rule.

53
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,980
"Avoid civilization at all cost."

54
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,200
We got to eat, don't we?

55
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,870
Open your mouth.

56
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:13,740
It's true we haven't done this
for awhile but...

57
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,340
...for God sakes,
it's like riding a bicycle, Bill.

58
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:20,180
What are you so worried about?

59
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,615
All you got to do is stand there.

60
00:07:22,715 --> 00:07:25,030
I'm the one with all the lines.

61
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,190
Open up.

62
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,990
Awful. Just awful.

63
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,538
<i>They said, "Fear not, Macbeth...</i>

64
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,640
<i>...till Birnam Wood...</i>

65
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:50,860
<i>...comes to Dunsinane."</i>

66
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:00,170
I said:

67
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:03,935
<i>"Till Birnam Wood</i>
<i>comes to Dunsinane!"</i>

68
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:08,420
Thank you.

69
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:13,240
<i>Arm yourselves!</i>

70
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,410
<i>Quickly, now.</i>

71
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,820
<i>Arm yourselves.</i>

72
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:29,405
<i>If the witch's words are true...</i>

73
00:08:29,505 --> 00:08:32,230
<i>...there'll be no running,</i>

74
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,580
<i>Now, fight...</i>

75
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:37,420
<i>...as if our last meal</i>
<i>depended on it, Bill.</i>

76
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,580
<i>Tomorrow...</i>

77
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,380
<i>- And tomorrow...</i>
- Tomorrow.

78
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:56,830
<i>And the day after that.</i>

79
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:59,390
<i>Out, brief candle!</i>

80
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:02,020
<i>Life's but a walking shadow...</i>

81
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,790
<i>...a poor player who struts...</i>

82
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:07,520
<i>...and frets his hour upon a stage...</i>

83
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,470
<i>...and is heard no more.</i>

84
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,445
<i>It's a tale told by...</i>

85
00:09:13,545 --> 00:09:16,030
Idiot.
<i>- A moron...</i>

86
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:19,340
<i>...full of sound and fury...</i>

87
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:21,660
<i>...signifying...</i>

88
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,260
<i>...nothing.</i>

89
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,660
<i>But blow, wind!</i>

90
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,110
<i>Come, wrack!</i>

91
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,150
<i>At least we'll die...</i>

92
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,380
<i>...with the harness off our back!</i>

93
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,980
I want to talk to him.

94
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:08,100
The children have never seen
Shakespeare before.

95
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,460
They still haven't.

96
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:13,385
Thank you. You're very kind.

97
00:10:13,485 --> 00:10:16,480
I'm clapping because you stink.

98
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:17,735
Larry!

99
00:10:17,835 --> 00:10:19,705
I don't think you know how it works.

100
00:10:19,805 --> 00:10:23,575
When I was young, I tried to be
an actor. I was awful.

101
00:10:23,675 --> 00:10:27,425
But now I won't die thinking
I was the worst one.

102
00:10:27,525 --> 00:10:28,780
- Stop it!
- That's all right.

103
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,390
How much did you pay to get in?

104
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:33,950
So bite me.

105
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:36,990
You were very good.

106
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:41,620
- Good enough to get something to eat?
- Yes, we have some soup.

107
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,780
Holnists. Goddamn!

108
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:03,100
Bastards hardly kill anyone lately.

109
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,820
We give them food and supplies.

110
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,700
All the towns do.

111
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,710
I'd just as soon not give them
anything of mine, thanks.

112
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:50,940
What are you doing there?

113
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:57,940
What are you doing?

114
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:05,180
It's just a game, General Bethlehem.

115
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:08,215
It's something they saw in a play.
No harm in it.

116
00:12:08,315 --> 00:12:09,420
Wait a minute!

117
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,350
A play?

118
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:12,930
Show me.

119
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,940
It's all right, children.
Show me.

120
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:22,295
Arm yourselves.

121
00:12:22,395 --> 00:12:24,140
No running from the witches.

122
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:27,660
Shakespeare, is it?

123
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,020
I'm sorry I missed it.

124
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,460
We haven't nearly stocked the game
that we thought we would.

125
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:36,740
Really?
But you had time for a play?

126
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,735
I'm taking three conscripts...

127
00:12:41,835 --> 00:12:43,260
...from each town!

128
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,020
You will have the honor
of serving in the Holnist Army...

129
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,820
...until such time as I see fit!
Three men.

130
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:51,910
Could you do that?

131
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:55,090
Captain!

132
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:58,225
All men...

133
00:12:58,325 --> 00:13:00,345
...between 15 and 50...

134
00:13:00,445 --> 00:13:04,990
...and of suitable ethnic foundation
are required to show themselves now!

135
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:12,470
General.

136
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,260
No, but keep that.

137
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,385
Acceptable.

138
00:13:36,485 --> 00:13:37,580
Sir?

139
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:39,540
Acceptable, Captain.

140
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,180
Need some meat on you,
but I like an impressionable mind.

141
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,700
Acceptable.

142
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,175
Mongoloid.

143
00:14:00,275 --> 00:14:01,910
Unacceptable.

144
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,510
I want pure blood.

145
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,070
Someone...

146
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:09,780
Someone...

147
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,540
- Don't wave.
- People, you will look at me!

148
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,180
Someone like...

149
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:29,380
Like that man!

150
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,830
Aw, Bill.

151
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:42,980
You don't understand.

152
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,115
You were required to show yourself.

153
00:14:45,215 --> 00:14:47,990
I'm not with them.
I'm just passing through.

154
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,220
Take the mule.

155
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:25,300
Whoa! Ah! Ah!

156
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,780
Let's go! Move!

157
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,620
Hey.

158
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,980
Hi. Hi. Hi.

159
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:56,500
Wow.

160
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:57,950
Ten-hut!

161
00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:00,110
I want a line right here.

162
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,510
Welcome, gentlemen,
to your new life.

163
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:19,580
You have been born again as soldiers
in the United Army of Nathan Holn.

164
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,780
God rest his soul!

165
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,020
The strong have been sapped...

166
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:27,180
...by the whimpering propaganda
of the weak.

167
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:29,150
Men...

168
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,575
...strong men
have been denied their destiny.

169
00:17:32,675 --> 00:17:35,260
You men have been saved
from that fate.

170
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:36,940
Redemption...

171
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,980
...is within your grasp.

172
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,300
You.

173
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:52,660
What did you do
before you were given this opportunity?

174
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,460
I had a shovel.
I digged holes.

175
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:57,340
You digged holes.

176
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,990
Now you'll fill them.

177
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:07,650
Hi.

178
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:17,140
And you?

179
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,620
Me?

180
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:22,745
Is there any question in anyone's mind
that I was speaking to you?

181
00:18:22,845 --> 00:18:24,420
Yes, you.

182
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:26,420
I'm just a performer.

183
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:29,380
Shakespeare. Stuff like that.

184
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:32,740
- Shakespeare?
- He was a writer.

185
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:34,910
Yes, I know.

186
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:37,580
I know who Shakespeare was.

187
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,960
<i>"Cry 'Havoc!'...</i>

188
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:42,535
<i>...and let slip...</i>

189
00:18:42,635 --> 00:18:44,340
<i>...the dogs of war."</i>

190
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,660
Me?

191
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:02,580
<i>"To be or not to be:</i>

192
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:04,370
<i>That is the question."</i>

193
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:17,980
<i>"We few...</i>

194
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,390
<i>...we happy few...</i>

195
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:22,340
<i>...we band of brothers!"</i>

196
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:42,495
<i>"Now is the winter of our discontent</i>
<i>made glorious summer...</i>

197
00:19:42,595 --> 00:19:44,340
<i>...by this sun of York."</i>

198
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,670
No, no, no. No.

199
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,380
You're pretty good.

200
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:00,740
You're also a fighter.
I can see it in your eyes.

201
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,860
You are a dangerous man.

202
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:06,575
Don't you agree?

203
00:20:06,675 --> 00:20:10,260
No disrespect, sir,
but you'd be better off letting me go.

204
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,460
A fighter is
about the last thing that I am.

205
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,060
Don't you think I should be
the judge of that, soldier?

206
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:31,940
Get up.

207
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,300
I said, get up!

208
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,540
You're right.
You're not a fighter.

209
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,100
But you will be.

210
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:55,040
I'm giving you a chance
at a life...

211
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,735
...that means something.

212
00:20:56,835 --> 00:20:58,300
A life worth living.

213
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:02,820
<i>- I'm glad to see you.</i>
<i>- We missed you.</i>

214
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:05,910
<i>- I missed you. Kurt, how are you?</i>
<i>- Hungry.</i>

215
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,660
<i>- Gretl, what happened to your finger?</i>
<i>- It got caught.</i>

216
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:13,260
<i>- Caught in what?</i>
<i>- Friedrich's teeth.</i>

217
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,060
Thanks.

218
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,860
Did I Win?

219
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,350
I tried to tell him.

220
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,700
Say it again.

221
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:43,190
Say what?

222
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:45,940
Words you said in town.

223
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:49,100
About the wind blowing and the rest.
Say it again.

224
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:52,700
<i>"Blow, wind.</i>
<i>Come, wrack.</i>

225
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:56,510
<i>At least we'll die</i>
<i>with the harness off our back."</i>

226
00:21:58,110 --> 00:21:59,550
What's it mean?

227
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:03,360
<i>"Live free or...</i>

228
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:04,540
<i>...die."</i>

229
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,060
I think.

230
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:10,420
You're going to watch a movie
or you can sleep!

231
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,860
But tomorrow...

232
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,520
...you run in uniform...

233
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:15,710
...full packs...

234
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:17,790
...20 miles!

235
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:19,780
Everybody makes it...

236
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,180
...or nobody eats...

237
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,430
...for the third day in a row!

238
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:19,055
Everybody up.

239
00:23:19,155 --> 00:23:21,060
You got meat tonight.

240
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:31,140
Why don't you tell Shakespeare
what kind it is?

241
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:35,260
Mule.

242
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,180
God-awful animal.

243
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:43,380
Sterile offspring of horse and donkey.

244
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:46,020
Can you imagine that?

245
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:49,900
There's no room in the New World
for a bastard like that.

246
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,310
Uh-uh.

247
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:04,940
Any man last in line
ain't hungry enough to eat.

248
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,620
You show up last...

249
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,340
...you don't eat!

250
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:28,635
I'm going to die
before I'm last in line again!

251
00:24:28,735 --> 00:24:30,900
That's what they're hoping for.

252
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,510
Shut up! At least you're eating!

253
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:42,180
You serious?

254
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:53,220
Good.

255
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,420
This is good!

256
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:30,070
You want this?!

257
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:33,475
This is what you want?

258
00:25:33,575 --> 00:25:35,140
All right!

259
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:45,970
Babies!

260
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:07,700
These were supposed to be
the best years of my life.

261
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:13,740
Halt!

262
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,985
The Laws of Eight, gentlemen.

263
00:26:19,085 --> 00:26:22,895
That is the legacy
handed down to us by Nathan Holn.

264
00:26:22,995 --> 00:26:24,090
May he burn in hell.

265
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,740
These are the laws that we live by.

266
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,900
The eight is our symbol.

267
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,900
Each man will bear it with pride.

268
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:37,860
Only then will you be part of the clan.

269
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,780
Sit down, gentlemen.

270
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,270
Law One:

271
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:02,940
You will obey orders without question.
I told you to sit.

272
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:07,355
There weren't enough chairs.

273
00:27:07,455 --> 00:27:10,660
I didn't specify chairs.
You could've sat on the ground.

274
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:14,560
You disobeyed a direct order.
You broke...

275
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:15,870
...Law One.

276
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:17,540
Law Two:

277
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,630
Punishment shall be swift.

278
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:21,510
I didn't do anything!

279
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,860
Law Three:

280
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,135
Mercy...

281
00:27:26,235 --> 00:27:28,140
...is for the weak.

282
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:32,220
Four

283
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,460
Terror...

284
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:38,020
...will defeat reason.

285
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:39,660
Five:

286
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:42,560
Your allegiance is to the clan.

287
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:44,320
Help.

288
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:45,500
Six:

289
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:48,040
Justice can be dictated.

290
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:49,500
Help me!

291
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,470
Seven:

292
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:56,020
Any clansmen may challenge
for leadership of the clan.

293
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,420
Does anyone
wish to challenge me?

294
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:01,550
Please. I didn't do anything.

295
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,150
On your feet.

296
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:06,820
Law Eight:

297
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:12,620
There's only one penalty.
Death.

298
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,300
Please!
I'm begging you!

299
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:17,140
Please, help!

300
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:36,190
You will get out of this army
what you put into it.

301
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:38,900
Work and you'll be fed.

302
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:41,500
Fight and you'll be respected.

303
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:45,260
Die and you'll be remembered.

304
00:28:55,910 --> 00:28:58,380
You thinking of challenging
for leadership?

305
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,160
No, sir.

306
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:01,900
I'm a follower...

307
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,620
...not a leader.

308
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,280
You got a smart mouth...

309
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:06,630
...Shakespeare.

310
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:09,910
You see Colonel Getty
always following the General?

311
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:12,895
He was the last man ever to challenge.

312
00:29:12,995 --> 00:29:14,700
Fight lasted six seconds...

313
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:17,940
...but he didn't kill him.

314
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:19,990
Cut off his tongue...

315
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,420
...then he cut off his balls.

316
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:27,140
And old Getty's been following him
around like a dog ever since.

317
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,420
Fall out!

318
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:35,220
The general don't see it...

319
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,710
...but I say
you've got some nigger in you.

320
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,550
They're yours?

321
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,900
Yes, sir.

322
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:06,060
A solitary man, aren't you?

323
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:10,340
Binoculars to watch life from a distance
and Shakespeare...

324
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,700
...to read about it,
instead of living it.

325
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:16,420
No offense, but you seem
to have read Shakespeare...

326
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,660
...yourself.

327
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:23,040
If he wishes to rise
above mere thuggery...

328
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:26,300
...a military commander
must be classically educated...

329
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:29,620
...philosophy and history,
even a sense of the dramatic.

330
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:35,620
What do you think that I did
before the war?

331
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:38,190
Do you think
that I was in the army?

332
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:40,940
I sold copying machines.

333
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:42,630
I was a salesman...

334
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:47,380
...with the talent to lead men,
devise and execute a battle plan...

335
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,115
...locked away inside.

336
00:30:49,215 --> 00:30:53,420
If Nathan Holn hadn't come along,
I'd still be selling copying machines.

337
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:55,820
Can you imagine...

338
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:59,380
...the wasted life?
Can you imagine the magnitude of that?

339
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,620
But war...

340
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:04,700
...war gives men like me a chance.

341
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,270
Here.

342
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,540
<i>"The prize is often left unclaimed.</i>

343
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:18,300
<i>We must have the courage to grasp it...</i>

344
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:21,060
<i>...for fortune always favors the bold."</i>

345
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,020
He always inspires me.

346
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:41,340
I have a design for the future.
A master plan.

347
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:45,260
I will need able officers
to help me carry it out.

348
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,300
You have the intelligence.

349
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,175
If your heart matches...

350
00:31:50,275 --> 00:31:51,855
...you will go far.

351
00:31:51,955 --> 00:31:53,550
We'll talk more in weeks to come.

352
00:31:53,790 --> 00:31:55,135
Dismissed.

353
00:31:55,235 --> 00:31:56,420
Captain!

354
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,700
We'll be moving out tomorrow.

355
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,620
Issue those binoculars to a scout.

356
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:03,300
And the book, sir?

357
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,700
Burn it.

358
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:12,700
Quit moving!

359
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,180
What happened?

360
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:23,310
- What happened? What'd he say?
- Nothing.

361
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:25,535
Did he say anything about me?

362
00:32:25,635 --> 00:32:26,730
No!

363
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:34,900
- I'm getting out of here.
- What are you talking about?

364
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,545
- Escaping
- What?!

365
00:32:38,645 --> 00:32:41,295
You ever hear of Saint Rose?
It's on the coast.

366
00:32:41,395 --> 00:32:42,780
- It's a paradise.
- We can't.

367
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,000
We could!

368
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:46,270
Between the three of us we could.

369
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,180
I can't.

370
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:55,060
I like it here.
I like being a part of something.

371
00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:22,500
<i>Take a point!</i>

372
00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:40,830
General.

373
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,495
Some of the men shot a lion.

374
00:33:43,595 --> 00:33:45,220
They crawled into the thicket.

375
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:56,820
One of you dogs earned a treat.

376
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,460
Over there.

377
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:02,590
Those men hunted a lion this morning.

378
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:06,400
Must've been a goddamn zoo here
before the war.

379
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:09,630
Anyway, a third man went in after it.

380
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,620
We don't know if he's alive or dead.

381
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,740
I want a volunteer.

382
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,980
One of you
is going in there after him.

383
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,020
I'll go.

384
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:33,820
I guess size
ain't a measure of courage.

385
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:35,350
Is it?

00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,870

387
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:57,150
I don't think so, captain!

388
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:06,780
Come out alive,
you get a lion steak!

389
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:16,350
Maybe you'll find your Saint Rose
over there.

390
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:24,500
What the hell are you waiting for,
Christmas?

391
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:34,130
Ow.

392
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:14,740
Why are you stopping?

393
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:22,350
I found him.

394
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,300
He got him.

395
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:30,980
Let's go.

396
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:01,980
Hurry up!

397
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,860
You still got a lion to bag!

398
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,754
Wow.

399
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:28,460
You men get back in line!

400
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,660
- There he is!
- Shoot him!

401
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,594
You!

402
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,900
In the water.
Come back without him...

403
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,380
...and you and another man
will die in his place.

404
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,780
Go! Go!

405
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:55,380
I'll get him!

406
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:08,130
Go!

407
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,140
Whoo!

408
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,430
Don't.

409
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:39,300
Just let me go.

410
00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:41,980
I don't want to be a part of your army.

411
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:43,900
My army?

412
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:46,900
I like the sound of that.

413
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,510
I got him!

414
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:53,110
I'm sorry.

415
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,300
How come...

416
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:04,780
How come...

417
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,100
...you wrecked it...

418
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:09,100
...for me?

419
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:22,350
It's me or you.

420
00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:24,540
What?

421
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,940
It doesn't have to be.

422
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:31,900
We can go together.
You and me.

423
00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:35,860
Good boy!

424
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,260
Good boy.

425
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,860
Get him.

426
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:48,620
Finish it!

427
00:40:50,310 --> 00:40:51,410
No.

428
00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:55,940
That's it.

429
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,180
Get him.

00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:07,020
Get him!

432
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:09,780
Get him, damn it!

00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:16,890

438
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,220
Well, bleeder...

439
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:00,470
...you want your Saint Rose?

440
00:42:00,990 --> 00:42:03,140
I'll give you your Saint Rose.

441
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:20,980
How you doing?

442
00:45:21,910 --> 00:45:23,470
You shouldn't have.

443
00:45:46,470 --> 00:45:48,100
Here's a piece of good news.

444
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:50,255
Jerry's decided to go to school...

445
00:45:50,355 --> 00:45:53,180
...to get his contractor's license.

446
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:54,940
Hm?

447
00:45:55,070 --> 00:45:56,500
Good, Jerry.

448
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:13,015
And little Jimmy wants his grandpa
to know that he lost...

449
00:46:13,115 --> 00:46:14,580
...a tooth.

450
00:47:57,590 --> 00:47:59,620

00:49:48,995 --> 00:49:52,820
...tampering with or obstructing

00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:34,420
- You know, I'm pretty hungry.
- Come on.

548
00:54:35,910 --> 00:54:37,180
Please!

549
00:54:39,990 --> 00:54:41,300
His name...

550
00:54:41,750 --> 00:54:42,850
...is...

551
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:45,620
...Richard Starkey.

552
00:54:47,790 --> 00:54:49,340
From Maine.

553
00:54:50,510 --> 00:54:52,020
He has a saying.

554
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:55,140
"Stuffs getting better.

555
00:54:55,310 --> 00:54:57,590
Stuff's getting better every day."

556
00:54:58,950 --> 00:55:01,420
Is he a Democrat or a Republican?

557
00:55:03,670 --> 00:55:05,620
Parties are over with.

558
00:55:05,990 --> 00:55:08,475
It's an individual that counts.

559
00:55:08,575 --> 00:55:09,860
What about Europe?

560
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:12,260
- Europe?
- Any Word?

561
00:55:13,350 --> 00:55:14,455
Well, there's...

562
00:55:14,555 --> 00:55:16,020
...good air in Iceland.

563
00:55:16,590 --> 00:55:18,740
Is Nathan Holn still alive?

564
00:55:21,710 --> 00:55:22,820
He died.

565
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:26,240
Skin cancer.

566
00:55:26,340 --> 00:55:27,775
He may be dead...

567
00:55:27,875 --> 00:55:32,580
...but what about the Holnists?
What'll the government do about them?

568
00:55:35,390 --> 00:55:38,380
The government's just getting started.

569
00:55:39,550 --> 00:55:43,220
So you're going to be on your own
for 6, 8 or 18 months.

570
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:47,500
How about the Marine Corps?

571
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:50,300
Be quiet. Everyone be quiet.

572
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:54,060
Can't we just let this man eat?

573
00:55:55,750 --> 00:55:57,070
Let us pray.

574
00:56:01,790 --> 00:56:05,420
Lord, we give you thanks for this food...

575
00:56:05,670 --> 00:56:06,975
...this day...

576
00:56:07,075 --> 00:56:08,940
...this man and his good news...

577
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:11,835
...evidence of your promise...

578
00:56:11,935 --> 00:56:13,820
...that you will
hold our country together.

579
00:56:14,150 --> 00:56:15,300
Amen.

580
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:57,620
Would you like to dance?

581
00:56:59,910 --> 00:57:01,855
I don't know if I can.

582
00:57:01,955 --> 00:57:03,860
I think I'm still on duty.

583
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:09,700
All you have to do is hold on.

584
00:57:27,230 --> 00:57:29,100
It's been a long time.

585
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:39,660
Something wrong?

586
00:57:41,990 --> 00:57:43,460
How tall are you?

587
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:45,895
About six feet.

588
00:57:45,995 --> 00:57:47,380
Are you smart?

589
00:57:49,470 --> 00:57:52,660
Smarter than some, I guess.
Why?

590
00:57:53,150 --> 00:57:54,580
Just wondering.

591
00:58:05,390 --> 00:58:07,460
Have you ever had the bad mumps?

592
00:58:08,950 --> 00:58:10,715
Never had the bad mumps.

593
00:58:10,815 --> 00:58:13,260
No syphilis, nothing like that?

594
00:58:16,230 --> 00:58:18,740
So as far as you know...

595
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:21,340
...you have good semen?

596
00:58:25,150 --> 00:58:27,220
Is that a trick question?

597
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:29,220
No, it's not.

598
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:33,340
I'm only asking...

599
00:58:33,750 --> 00:58:36,340
...because I want you
to make me pregnant.

600
00:58:38,670 --> 00:58:39,860
All right...

601
00:58:40,230 --> 00:58:41,460
...that's it.

602
00:58:41,990 --> 00:58:43,140
Wait.

603
00:58:43,270 --> 00:58:44,660
Wait, please.

604
00:58:47,270 --> 00:58:49,500
It's got to be the uniform.

605
00:58:50,310 --> 00:58:53,300
This is my husband, Michael.
He hasn't said no.

606
00:58:54,870 --> 00:58:56,540
I haven't said anything yet.

607
00:58:56,670 --> 00:58:59,375
We've been trying
to have a baby for three years.

608
00:58:59,475 --> 00:59:02,860
We cannot on account of Michael.
He had the bad mumps when he was 12.

609
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:05,940
So we need a body father.

610
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:09,755
We could ask a man here,
but it may cause problems.

611
00:59:09,855 --> 00:59:11,460
We've seen it happen.

612
00:59:11,590 --> 00:59:16,180
Things go okay until the woman shows,
then it can be difficult.

613
00:59:16,350 --> 00:59:19,420
But you'll only be around
once in a while with the mail.

614
00:59:22,150 --> 00:59:23,940
You're the postman.

615
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:25,980
What do you say, mister?

616
00:59:27,190 --> 00:59:28,340
You'd do us a favor.

617
00:59:32,230 --> 00:59:33,900
I'm going to think about it.

618
00:59:42,150 --> 00:59:43,660
Excuse me.

619
00:59:45,350 --> 00:59:48,380
My mother
would like to give you something.

620
00:59:50,150 --> 00:59:51,620
He's right here, Mom.

621
00:59:54,190 --> 00:59:56,135
It's to my other daughter...

622
00:59:56,235 --> 00:59:57,580
...Annie.

623
01:00:07,590 --> 01:00:08,700
It doesn't say where.

624
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:13,535
We don't know where she is.
She left five years ago.

625
01:00:13,635 --> 01:00:15,900
The last we heard
she was living up north.

626
01:00:18,070 --> 01:00:20,260
Look, Mrs. March,
you should know that...

627
01:00:20,550 --> 01:00:21,650
Know what?

628
01:00:25,390 --> 01:00:27,020
Know that...

629
01:00:29,150 --> 01:00:31,540
I have a feeling about you.

630
01:00:32,150 --> 01:00:34,620
I know you'll do what's right.

631
01:00:52,870 --> 01:00:54,100
I got to get out of here.

632
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:09,895
Easy, boy.

633
01:01:09,995 --> 01:01:11,700
It's right around the corner.

634
01:01:16,710 --> 01:01:19,220
- What is?
- What you're looking for.

635
01:01:29,790 --> 01:01:31,780
What I'm looking for?

636
01:01:35,710 --> 01:01:37,460
Crazy old coot.

637
01:02:17,950 --> 01:02:19,540
I knew you'd come here.

638
01:02:22,270 --> 01:02:23,700
You did?

639
01:02:27,470 --> 01:02:30,100
So how do you
get to be a postman, anyhow?

640
01:02:31,190 --> 01:02:34,980
You have to be in the right place
at the right time.

641
01:02:35,110 --> 01:02:36,660
How can I do it?

642
01:02:39,190 --> 01:02:43,340
- I thought you wanted to drive cars.
- Not anymore. That's kid's stuff.

643
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:44,820
This is real.

644
01:02:45,350 --> 01:02:47,060
So where's the right place?

645
01:02:49,270 --> 01:02:52,100
Could be anywhere, you know.
Anytime.

646
01:02:52,910 --> 01:02:56,020
Only another postman
can make you a postman.

647
01:02:56,230 --> 01:02:58,260
Kind of like vampires, right'?

648
01:03:00,870 --> 01:03:02,580
Yeah, something like that.

649
01:03:04,390 --> 01:03:05,940
You have to be sworn in,
so...

650
01:03:11,870 --> 01:03:15,575
The organization's kind of shaky
right now. It might not last.

651
01:03:15,675 --> 01:03:17,060
What does?

652
01:03:19,470 --> 01:03:21,455
You'd meet people
who don't believe in you.

653
01:03:21,555 --> 01:03:23,340
I'll set them straight.

654
01:03:25,030 --> 01:03:26,740
It's a lonely job.

655
01:03:27,750 --> 01:03:29,980
I've been lonely all my life.

656
01:03:31,750 --> 01:03:33,300
So have I, Ford.

657
01:03:34,070 --> 01:03:35,540
So have I.

658
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:38,460
What the hell!

659
01:03:39,230 --> 01:03:40,660
You repeat after me.

660
01:03:44,510 --> 01:03:46,120
<i>"Neither snow...</i>

661
01:03:46,220 --> 01:03:47,540
<i>...nor rain...</i>

662
01:03:47,710 --> 01:03:49,060
<i>...nor heat...</i>

663
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:50,620
<i>...nor gloom of night...</i>

664
01:03:55,360 --> 01:03:57,100
<i>...stays these couriers...</i>

665
01:03:57,790 --> 01:04:01,460
<i>...from the swift completion</i>
<i>of their appointed rounds."</i>

666
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:04,900
- Okay, then.
- Okay, then.

667
01:04:05,950 --> 01:04:07,060
No.

668
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:09,275
No, I'm saying that.
You just listen.

669
01:04:09,375 --> 01:04:10,660
I'm sorry.

670
01:04:12,470 --> 01:04:15,580
By my authority you're now empowered
to carry the mail.

671
01:04:16,550 --> 01:04:17,940
Congratulations.

672
01:04:18,950 --> 01:04:20,860
You're a postman.

673
01:04:26,590 --> 01:04:28,580
I'd die to get a letter through.

674
01:04:30,310 --> 01:04:31,700
What did you say?

675
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:35,660
- I said I'd die to get a letter through.
- Johnny!

676
01:04:36,230 --> 01:04:37,700
Why don't you run along.

677
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:40,500
I need to speak to this man.

678
01:04:41,830 --> 01:04:43,460
I'll see you around.

679
01:04:44,150 --> 01:04:45,940
Sure thing, Ford.

680
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:52,455
Johnny is impressed with you.
Whole town is impressed with you.

681
01:04:52,555 --> 01:04:54,295
I take it you're not.

682
01:04:54,395 --> 01:04:57,760
- You're smarter than you look.
- What can I do for you?

683
01:04:57,860 --> 01:05:02,260
You can either clear out or I can
throw you out. Either way suits me.

684
01:05:02,950 --> 01:05:06,235
You don't understand. I'm
a government employee authorized by...

685
01:05:06,335 --> 01:05:08,940
You are not authorized by shit!

686
01:05:09,080 --> 01:05:11,735
You were trying to sneak out of here.
You are nothing...

687
01:05:11,835 --> 01:05:16,020
...but a drifter who found
a bag of mail. I want you out of town.

688
01:05:16,950 --> 01:05:20,100
All right. This is going in my report.

689
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:23,215
These people don't need dreams,
Mr. Postman.

690
01:05:23,315 --> 01:05:27,020
They need something real.
They need help with the Holnists.

691
01:05:27,120 --> 01:05:29,140
Are you going to bring them that?

692
01:05:31,190 --> 01:05:32,660
Didn't think so.

693
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:38,375
All you cost us so far is a few bowls
of soup and maybe a few broken hearts.

694
01:05:38,475 --> 01:05:40,500
I aim to keep it that way.

695
01:05:40,950 --> 01:05:42,940
You can stay here till morning...

696
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:45,940
...then I don't ever want
to see you again.

697
01:06:06,740 --> 01:06:08,213
Benning.

698
01:06:09,990 --> 01:06:11,700
Portland.

699
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:15,815
Boston?

700
01:06:15,915 --> 01:06:17,340
What the hell these people...

701
01:06:18,510 --> 01:06:20,180
Just leave it.

702
01:06:24,040 --> 01:06:26,020
I said, leave it.

703
01:06:32,270 --> 01:06:33,780
Saint Rose?

704
01:06:58,150 --> 01:06:59,700
Hello, Abby.

705
01:07:01,910 --> 01:07:03,500
You'll be leaving tomorrow?

706
01:07:05,510 --> 01:07:06,780
I guess.

707
01:07:11,710 --> 01:07:15,020
Everybody's up late writing letters
for you to take.

708
01:07:16,070 --> 01:07:17,820
They're so excited.

709
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:21,460
And how about you?
Do you have a letter?

710
01:07:21,790 --> 01:07:22,890
No.

711
01:07:23,630 --> 01:07:25,980
I don't have anybody to write to.

712
01:07:26,590 --> 01:07:28,300
I'll find you a pen pal.

713
01:07:29,070 --> 01:07:31,375
Someone with similar interests.
You know?

714
01:07:31,475 --> 01:07:33,260
Like dancing and...

715
01:07:34,430 --> 01:07:35,740
...checking for mumps.

716
01:07:36,750 --> 01:07:38,420
You're funny.

717
01:07:39,070 --> 01:07:40,900
Hardly anybody's funny around here.

718
01:07:47,510 --> 01:07:49,540
Have you decided yet?

719
01:07:58,870 --> 01:08:00,580
Oh, yeah.

720
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:03,220
Been thinking about it.

721
01:08:25,190 --> 01:08:26,580
Sure.

722
01:08:27,310 --> 01:08:28,410
I mean...

723
01:08:29,590 --> 01:08:31,020
...why not?

724
01:08:38,230 --> 01:08:39,700
God, you're so...

725
01:08:40,550 --> 01:08:41,780
You're so...

726
01:08:42,550 --> 01:08:43,860
...beautiful.

727
01:08:45,870 --> 01:08:49,740
I'm sorry, you probably want
to keep things more clinical.

728
01:08:50,910 --> 01:08:53,140
You don't even know my name.

729
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:56,660
I don't want to.

730
01:09:02,950 --> 01:09:04,575
It would be easier for me...

731
01:09:04,675 --> 01:09:06,820
...if you closed your eyes.

732
01:11:26,790 --> 01:11:28,580
We took a vote, Mr. Postman.

733
01:11:29,030 --> 01:11:30,500
We want you to have this.

734
01:11:37,470 --> 01:11:38,860
So you can't say no.

735
01:11:43,030 --> 01:11:44,300
Okay.

736
01:11:44,510 --> 01:11:46,100
I'll take it.

737
01:11:48,670 --> 01:11:51,460
You got a bedroll, some oats
and a week's rations.

738
01:11:51,710 --> 01:11:52,860
Good.

739
01:11:53,350 --> 01:11:54,455
Thank you.

740
01:11:54,555 --> 01:11:56,580
Where will you go from here?

741
01:11:57,310 --> 01:11:58,420
Go?

742
01:12:00,870 --> 01:12:02,340
Oh, yeah.

743
01:12:04,270 --> 01:12:06,020
West...

744
01:12:07,750 --> 01:12:09,375
...then I'll work my way...

745
01:12:09,475 --> 01:12:11,820
...back here,
sort of a figure eight.

746
01:12:18,630 --> 01:12:20,700
Times seem hard right now.

747
01:12:20,870 --> 01:12:23,180
But you got to believe
things are getting better.

748
01:12:26,070 --> 01:12:28,020
Birds are migrating again.

749
01:12:28,190 --> 01:12:29,740
The rains are back.

750
01:12:31,310 --> 01:12:32,460
Stuff's...

751
01:12:32,670 --> 01:12:34,380
Stuff's getting better.

752
01:12:51,470 --> 01:12:52,860
Shit!

753
01:12:53,640 --> 01:12:55,420
You've got a hell of a nerve,
whoever you are.

754
01:13:02,390 --> 01:13:04,580
Did you see Abby around this morning?

755
01:13:06,990 --> 01:13:08,740
This is as far as I go.

756
01:13:09,190 --> 01:13:10,460
You're on your own.

757
01:13:18,550 --> 01:13:19,984
Hey!

758
01:13:22,310 --> 01:13:24,540
Are you really
who you say you are?

759
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,420
If I come back with some mail...

760
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:29,140
...you'll know.

761
01:13:35,630 --> 01:13:37,060
Goddamn it!

762
01:14:06,150 --> 01:14:08,260
What are you looking at?

763
01:14:09,270 --> 01:14:10,860
Everything.

764
01:15:09,030 --> 01:15:11,020
They don't usually look at me.

765
01:15:26,350 --> 01:15:28,980
Who is responsible...

766
01:15:29,310 --> 01:15:30,660
...for that?

767
01:15:34,830 --> 01:15:36,260
I said...

768
01:15:36,360 --> 01:15:38,815
..."Who's responsible...

769
01:15:38,915 --> 01:15:40,060
...for that?"

770
01:15:45,670 --> 01:15:48,180
Holnists, Johnny.
You got to stay...

771
01:15:50,470 --> 01:15:53,095
- You got to stay out of sight.
- I'm a postman!

772
01:15:53,195 --> 01:15:55,195
And I'm not running from anybody!

773
01:15:55,295 --> 01:15:58,260
Stay out of this,
or I will lock you up myself.

774
01:16:06,590 --> 01:16:08,024
You.

775
01:16:08,830 --> 01:16:09,980
You'll be responsible.

776
01:16:18,390 --> 01:16:20,700
Now set that flag on fire.

777
01:16:46,470 --> 01:16:49,100
Throw it through the window
of your post office.

778
01:16:49,950 --> 01:16:51,735
Do it, Michael.

779
01:16:51,835 --> 01:16:54,020
It's all right, Michael. Throw it.

780
01:16:58,910 --> 01:17:00,615
The United States...

781
01:17:00,715 --> 01:17:02,740
...doesn't exist!

782
01:17:05,270 --> 01:17:07,580
That flag is an abomination!

783
01:17:28,910 --> 01:17:33,260
There was the strangest little goat
and it was behind a fence and it...

784
01:17:35,230 --> 01:17:36,620
Damn.

785
01:17:40,550 --> 01:17:41,650
No.

786
01:17:43,350 --> 01:17:46,420
I looked at it and it had a color to it.

787
01:17:51,310 --> 01:17:52,580
Good.

788
01:17:52,790 --> 01:17:54,100
Everything.

789
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:58,420
I was amazed.
It was...

790
01:17:59,390 --> 01:18:00,780
Good Lord!

791
01:18:02,310 --> 01:18:03,580
That, gentlemen...

792
01:18:04,550 --> 01:18:06,900
...is a first-rate piece of ass.

793
01:18:09,480 --> 01:18:13,700
Tell the sheriff to introduce me.
She doesn't belong in this mudhole.

794
01:18:13,830 --> 01:18:15,060
Excuse me.

795
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:17,780
You again!

796
01:18:18,630 --> 01:18:20,300
That's my wife, general.

797
01:18:20,750 --> 01:18:22,140
She's a married woman.

798
01:18:22,470 --> 01:18:23,700
Really?

799
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:29,140
Do you know what system of government
we have here?

800
01:18:30,830 --> 01:18:34,735
We have what is known as a feudal
system, like in the Middle Ages.

801
01:18:34,835 --> 01:18:37,700
That's lords and vassals.
That's you and me.

802
01:18:38,630 --> 01:18:40,060
Now those lords...

803
01:18:40,160 --> 01:18:41,700
...they had some ideas.

804
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:44,855
They believed that
if a vassal got married...

805
01:18:44,955 --> 01:18:47,055
...it was the lord's right...

806
01:18:47,155 --> 01:18:48,420
...his right...

807
01:18:48,950 --> 01:18:51,620
...to sleep with the bride
on the wedding night.

808
01:18:57,830 --> 01:18:59,420
Me and Abby
have been married 3 years.

809
01:19:00,550 --> 01:19:03,300
I'm sorry, but I wasn't invited
to the wedding.

810
01:19:09,510 --> 01:19:11,780
You've already done me one favor, son.

811
01:19:12,510 --> 01:19:15,220
Don't let this be a black mark
on an otherwise perfect record.

812
01:19:20,070 --> 01:19:21,780
Abby.

813
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:26,460
We'll be civilized about this.

814
01:19:26,590 --> 01:19:29,620
I want you to give me your blessing.

815
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:39,060
Sir, I can't.

816
01:19:40,270 --> 01:19:41,540
You can't?

817
01:19:43,710 --> 01:19:44,810
You can't.

818
01:19:46,590 --> 01:19:48,100
"Can't."

819
01:19:52,760 --> 01:19:55,420
We had a great nation once.

820
01:19:57,150 --> 01:19:58,420
Know what made it great?

821
01:20:00,070 --> 01:20:01,460
"I can."

822
01:20:02,430 --> 01:20:03,740
Till the weak came along.

823
01:20:05,110 --> 01:20:07,380
The "I can'ts" destroyed us!

824
01:20:09,190 --> 01:20:11,180
I'm going to make us strong again.

825
01:20:11,430 --> 01:20:13,460
I'm going to be the father...

826
01:20:13,670 --> 01:20:15,180
...of a new nation.

827
01:20:16,030 --> 01:20:17,575
And do you know why...

828
01:20:17,675 --> 01:20:19,260
...it will be me?

829
01:20:23,430 --> 01:20:25,300
Because I can.

830
01:20:30,830 --> 01:20:33,020
- Michael!
- Abby!

831
01:20:34,630 --> 01:20:35,980
Stop it!

832
01:20:37,830 --> 01:20:38,930
Please.

833
01:20:40,150 --> 01:20:41,580
You're killing him!

834
01:20:42,160 --> 01:20:43,700
Let me go!

835
01:20:45,270 --> 01:20:47,340
Please, let me go!

836
01:20:47,550 --> 01:20:49,100
Abby.

837
01:20:54,070 --> 01:20:56,100
Help him, somebody!
Please!

838
01:20:56,550 --> 01:20:57,780
Abby.

839
01:21:01,030 --> 01:21:02,460
On your horses.

840
01:21:04,270 --> 01:21:05,700
You didn't have to...!

841
01:21:06,470 --> 01:21:08,060
Didn't have to what?

842
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:12,420
You bastard!

843
01:21:14,070 --> 01:21:15,540
You killed him!

844
01:21:16,190 --> 01:21:18,380
Your people seem seditious.

845
01:21:19,630 --> 01:21:21,700
You seem seditious.

846
01:21:22,830 --> 01:21:25,140
What am I seeing here?

847
01:21:25,480 --> 01:21:27,100
I'm waiting!

848
01:21:35,430 --> 01:21:39,355
A man came through with mail.
Said he was a postman.

849
01:21:39,455 --> 01:21:42,175
Said that the government
had been restored back east.

850
01:21:42,275 --> 01:21:44,180
What government?

851
01:21:44,590 --> 01:21:47,580
The United States government!

852
01:21:49,360 --> 01:21:50,540
Who said that?

853
01:22:07,790 --> 01:22:10,060
Which way did he go?

854
01:22:10,790 --> 01:22:13,540
- Do not make me ask again.
- East.

855
01:22:14,590 --> 01:22:16,500
Send a patrol east!

856
01:22:17,030 --> 01:22:18,220
Send 3 more...

857
01:22:18,630 --> 01:22:20,220
...north, south and west!

858
01:22:21,510 --> 01:22:23,380
They'd better find him east.

859
01:22:42,550 --> 01:22:44,900
Take that damn shirt off, Johnny!

860
01:22:48,070 --> 01:22:49,920
I managed to save these.

861
01:22:50,020 --> 01:22:51,900
Do you want to die too?

862
01:22:53,630 --> 01:22:56,300
I'm headed south with the mail.

863
01:22:57,110 --> 01:22:58,260
John.

864
01:22:59,030 --> 01:23:00,700
Don't be a fool.

865
01:23:01,270 --> 01:23:02,860
What should I be?

866
01:23:14,390 --> 01:23:16,580
Rachel Clark.

867
01:23:19,110 --> 01:23:21,430
"Charlie Sykes."

868
01:23:21,530 --> 01:23:22,610
Charlie.

869
01:23:27,990 --> 01:23:29,540
"Graham Drewitt."

870
01:23:30,110 --> 01:23:32,820
G.D. died of flu last winter.

871
01:23:35,230 --> 01:23:36,980
That's all there is.

872
01:23:38,590 --> 01:23:39,940
That's all there is, folks.

873
01:23:40,390 --> 01:23:41,860
For now.

874
01:23:42,440 --> 01:23:47,060
But there'll be more, lots more,
once there's a real system in place.

875
01:23:48,230 --> 01:23:49,330
Right?

876
01:23:52,950 --> 01:23:55,020
What about New York City?

877
01:23:55,630 --> 01:23:57,020
Did they survive the plague?

878
01:23:59,830 --> 01:24:01,140
Survive?

879
01:24:03,790 --> 01:24:06,170
They got Broadway up and running again.

880
01:24:09,750 --> 01:24:12,695
There's a kid doing Andrew Floyd Webber,
you wouldn't believe.

881
01:24:12,795 --> 01:24:14,500
How much is it to mail a letter?

882
01:24:15,430 --> 01:24:16,660
Mail...

883
01:24:43,510 --> 01:24:44,900
They won't open the gates.

884
01:24:46,070 --> 01:24:47,130
What?

885
01:24:47,230 --> 01:24:51,140
They say they got a representative
of the Restored United States in there.

886
01:24:51,910 --> 01:24:53,420
They say this army is illegal.

887
01:24:54,030 --> 01:24:55,775
- And they say...
- Drop dead!

888
01:24:55,875 --> 01:24:57,980
And go to hell!

889
01:25:00,070 --> 01:25:01,435
That's what they say.

890
01:25:01,535 --> 01:25:03,580
What are you doing?!
Open the gates.

891
01:25:07,830 --> 01:25:09,020
Idiots!

892
01:25:12,390 --> 01:25:13,620
What're you thinking?!

893
01:25:15,640 --> 01:25:18,455
The Romans had an expression...

894
01:25:18,555 --> 01:25:21,380
...they used to scare their children.

895
01:25:22,670 --> 01:25:24,060
<i>"Hannibal...</i>

896
01:25:24,630 --> 01:25:26,740
<i>...ante portas!"</i>

897
01:25:27,910 --> 01:25:29,340
Hannibal...

898
01:25:30,070 --> 01:25:32,140
...is at the gates.

899
01:25:38,870 --> 01:25:40,780
Do you know who Hannibal was?

900
01:25:41,670 --> 01:25:43,810
No? Of course not.

901
01:25:43,910 --> 01:25:46,780
A pretty girl like you
wouldn't understand something like that.

902
01:25:49,230 --> 01:25:50,900
Oh, God.

903
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:53,595
- Let's fight them!
- With what?

904
01:25:53,695 --> 01:25:56,935
We've got five guns,
maybe 20 rounds of ammo.

905
01:25:57,035 --> 01:25:58,815
How we going to fight with that?

906
01:25:58,915 --> 01:26:00,140
You don't.

907
01:26:03,400 --> 01:26:05,300
Negotiate a settlement.

908
01:26:05,830 --> 01:26:07,180
Give them extra supplies.

909
01:26:07,590 --> 01:26:08,995
Yeah.

910
01:26:09,095 --> 01:26:10,580
Okay.

911
01:26:13,030 --> 01:26:15,100
You're the government rep.
Tell them.

912
01:26:15,750 --> 01:26:17,460
Yeah.

913
01:26:29,390 --> 01:26:30,915
Right here.

914
01:26:31,015 --> 01:26:32,340
Sir.

915
01:26:40,710 --> 01:26:43,500
Make it quick.
I've got an attack to coordinate.

916
01:26:44,470 --> 01:26:46,820
They've asked me
to negotiate a peace treaty.

917
01:26:50,390 --> 01:26:51,940
Do I know you?

918
01:26:52,670 --> 01:26:54,260
I don't think so, sir.

919
01:26:54,910 --> 01:26:57,900
You're the postman.
Aren't you?

920
01:27:01,190 --> 01:27:02,340
Inside!

921
01:27:06,510 --> 01:27:08,260
"U.S. Mail."

922
01:27:09,230 --> 01:27:12,140
Restored United States of America.

923
01:27:12,630 --> 01:27:15,540
Do these people
really believe that shit?!

924
01:27:16,790 --> 01:27:18,900
Who are you, really?

925
01:27:19,310 --> 01:27:21,450
I'm a United States postman...

926
01:27:21,710 --> 01:27:25,255
...authorized by Order 417
of the Restored Congress.

927
01:27:25,355 --> 01:27:29,410
I was at the Battle of Georgetown.
I watched the White House burn down.

928
01:27:29,510 --> 01:27:31,535
Do not try to sell me...

929
01:27:31,635 --> 01:27:34,020
...on any Restored United States!

930
01:27:36,590 --> 01:27:39,300
The new capital is based
in Minneapolis...

931
01:27:39,550 --> 01:27:42,100
...inside the Hubert Humphrey Metrodome.

932
01:27:42,550 --> 01:27:45,100
You know where the Vikings
used to play?

933
01:27:47,070 --> 01:27:48,500
You're funny.

934
01:27:53,710 --> 01:27:55,460
What are the terms?

935
01:27:56,390 --> 01:27:59,100
They'll open the gates,
give double the usual...

936
01:27:59,510 --> 01:28:01,900
...just don't hurt anybody.

937
01:28:02,070 --> 01:28:03,740
This was all a misunderstanding.

938
01:28:11,240 --> 01:28:13,375
I appreciate your offer, Mr. Postman.

939
01:28:13,475 --> 01:28:17,060
But the fact is that you're
in no position to negotiate.

940
01:28:17,430 --> 01:28:20,900
These people made it through the bugs
and the riots...

941
01:28:21,510 --> 01:28:24,820
...and the three-year winters,
but they're not going to survive you.

942
01:28:26,030 --> 01:28:27,540
Fire at will!

943
01:28:37,030 --> 01:28:38,455
Law Six:

944
01:28:38,555 --> 01:28:40,655
Justice can be...

945
01:28:40,755 --> 01:28:42,060
...dictated!

946
01:28:45,110 --> 01:28:48,700
Kill him, and kill
the Restored United States with him.

947
01:29:10,670 --> 01:29:11,825
In accordance with Law Eight...

948
01:29:11,925 --> 01:29:14,495
...and by the authority
of Emergency Order 46...

949
01:29:14,595 --> 01:29:15,860
...you are hereby...

950
01:29:23,120 --> 01:29:24,680
Get her!

951
01:29:24,780 --> 01:29:25,860
Argh!

952
01:30:15,990 --> 01:30:17,700
Go on, get him!

953
01:30:37,990 --> 01:30:40,020
We can't stop now.

954
01:30:42,390 --> 01:30:43,660
What are you...?

955
01:30:46,480 --> 01:30:47,780
Oh, God!

956
01:31:03,070 --> 01:31:04,540
Abby.

957
01:31:06,630 --> 01:31:07,740
Shh.

958
01:31:11,910 --> 01:31:13,220
Come on down.

959
01:31:30,670 --> 01:31:31,980
Don't move.

960
01:31:37,230 --> 01:31:38,330
No.

961
01:31:38,750 --> 01:31:40,540
If you had a bullet,
you'd use it.

962
01:32:53,070 --> 01:32:54,300
Come on.

963
01:33:44,110 --> 01:33:47,340
I don't think
I ever had water soup before.

964
01:33:48,030 --> 01:33:51,380
Maybe next time
we could try it with a little sand.

965
01:33:52,710 --> 01:33:54,020
Dirt.

966
01:33:55,950 --> 01:33:57,340
Maybe a twig garnish.

967
01:34:03,030 --> 01:34:05,060
You used to think I was funny.

968
01:34:08,790 --> 01:34:10,490
They killed Michael.

969
01:34:19,430 --> 01:34:20,540
I'm sorry.

970
01:34:24,550 --> 01:34:25,900
How sorry are you?

971
01:34:27,190 --> 01:34:28,290
What?

972
01:34:33,030 --> 01:34:35,140
What's that supposed to mean?

973
01:34:37,910 --> 01:34:41,020
- What's with you?
- You have the mark of 8 on you.

974
01:34:42,710 --> 01:34:45,540
- Mark doesn't mean...
- You're a liar.

975
01:34:48,390 --> 01:34:49,540
You were with Bethlehem.

976
01:34:50,430 --> 01:34:52,540
Does that make you one of them?

977
01:35:03,910 --> 01:35:06,060
Don't make me use this.

978
01:35:20,350 --> 01:35:21,940
Wind's come up.

979
01:35:22,150 --> 01:35:23,500
It's getting colder too.

980
01:35:24,230 --> 01:35:26,700
Must be another storm.

981
01:35:30,110 --> 01:35:31,580
Anything else?

982
01:35:33,110 --> 01:35:35,095
I didn't mean for you to...

983
01:35:35,195 --> 01:35:38,740
Your legs are going to rot off
if you don't try to walk.

984
01:35:38,990 --> 01:35:40,775
- I'm hurt.
- You're lazy!

985
01:35:40,875 --> 01:35:42,100
Lazy?

986
01:35:42,230 --> 01:35:44,475
I got a hole in my stomach...

987
01:35:44,575 --> 01:35:46,135
...and I'm weak.

988
01:35:46,235 --> 01:35:49,770
The two big meals around here
are snow and grass...

989
01:35:49,870 --> 01:35:51,980
...and we're running out of grass.

990
01:36:01,510 --> 01:36:02,860
What're you doing?

991
01:36:28,870 --> 01:36:30,140
Give me a break!

992
01:36:32,470 --> 01:36:33,820
I'm going to check the pass.

993
01:36:35,550 --> 01:36:37,215
Why are you in such a hurry?

994
01:36:37,315 --> 01:36:39,620
I could think of worse places.

995
01:36:40,470 --> 01:36:42,690
Or I could think of worse company.

996
01:36:49,670 --> 01:36:51,060
Perfect!

997
01:37:44,790 --> 01:37:45,890
Oh!

998
01:37:46,670 --> 01:37:47,860
Help!

999
01:37:48,590 --> 01:37:50,100
Help!

1000
01:37:50,630 --> 01:37:52,220
Help!

1001
01:37:54,910 --> 01:37:56,010
Help!

1002
01:37:59,430 --> 01:38:00,620
Please!

1003
01:38:01,830 --> 01:38:03,460
Quick!

1004
01:38:04,030 --> 01:38:07,340
- Abby!
- Oh, God.

1005
01:38:13,470 --> 01:38:15,100
God, help me!

1006
01:38:17,310 --> 01:38:21,300
Abby! Abby.-

1007
01:38:34,030 --> 01:38:36,060
I told you that's all there was.

1008
01:38:37,190 --> 01:38:39,260
That's why you should have it.

1009
01:38:44,350 --> 01:38:46,220
I knew you could walk.

1010
01:38:48,430 --> 01:38:49,740
You're weird.

1011
01:38:50,470 --> 01:38:52,260
Know that?

1012
01:39:14,030 --> 01:39:16,420
We walked on the moon once, Abby.

1013
01:39:17,150 --> 01:39:18,250
So?

1014
01:39:19,110 --> 01:39:21,100
What good is that now?

1015
01:39:22,470 --> 01:39:23,570
Oh.

1016
01:39:24,230 --> 01:39:26,130
Obviously you've forgotten...

1017
01:39:26,230 --> 01:39:27,660
...Tang and...

1018
01:39:28,230 --> 01:39:29,860
...microwave ovens and...

1019
01:39:35,950 --> 01:39:37,580
Your face looks pretty.

1020
01:39:42,150 --> 01:39:43,540
I mean...

1021
01:39:43,950 --> 01:39:46,010
...not so bruised.

1022
01:39:52,790 --> 01:39:54,100
Look...

1023
01:39:54,590 --> 01:39:56,140
...there's something
you'd better know.

1024
01:39:57,790 --> 01:39:59,940
You're going to find out soon enough.

1025
01:40:00,750 --> 01:40:02,100
I'm pregnant.

1026
01:40:04,710 --> 01:40:06,740
It's Michael's baby.

1027
01:40:07,910 --> 01:40:10,100
You're just the body father.

1028
01:40:15,190 --> 01:40:17,100
How do you know it's mine...

1029
01:40:19,070 --> 01:40:20,420
...not Bethlehem's?

1030
01:40:24,750 --> 01:40:27,420
He tried with me almost every night.

1031
01:40:30,830 --> 01:40:32,540
He couldn't do it...

1032
01:40:36,150 --> 01:40:37,820
...so he beat me.

1033
01:40:41,670 --> 01:40:43,820
Said it was my fault.

1034
01:40:49,590 --> 01:40:50,780
I'm sorry, Abby.

1035
01:41:25,830 --> 01:41:27,260
Abby?

1036
01:41:28,790 --> 01:41:30,180
What is it?

1037
01:41:31,110 --> 01:41:32,660
What's wrong?

1038
01:41:35,310 --> 01:41:36,460
Is it the baby?

1039
01:41:37,510 --> 01:41:39,100
The pass is clear.

1040
01:42:00,350 --> 01:42:01,860
What happened?

1041
01:42:04,070 --> 01:42:06,090
Good, you got our stuff out.

1042
01:42:06,190 --> 01:42:07,540
Of course.

1043
01:42:08,310 --> 01:42:09,500
What?

1044
01:42:11,230 --> 01:42:12,780
I don't understand.

1045
01:42:13,670 --> 01:42:15,620
I set the fire.

1046
01:42:18,590 --> 01:42:20,700
Did you think we'd stay here forever?

1047
01:42:21,150 --> 01:42:22,250
No.

1048
01:42:25,190 --> 01:42:28,975
I'd appreciate it if you'd walk with me
to find someplace safe for the baby...

1049
01:42:29,075 --> 01:42:30,875
...then we can split up.

1050
01:42:30,975 --> 01:42:32,820
You shaved.

1051
01:42:33,830 --> 01:42:35,500
Looks nice.

1052
01:42:41,710 --> 01:42:43,355
You're really weird!

1053
01:42:43,455 --> 01:42:44,820
You know that?

1054
01:42:51,750 --> 01:42:53,900
You ever heard of Saint Rose, Abby?

1055
01:42:54,310 --> 01:42:56,135
I've heard people talk.

1056
01:42:56,235 --> 01:42:58,380
I've heard lots of names...

1057
01:42:58,830 --> 01:43:01,580
...Bliss, Hesperia, and New Eden.

1058
01:43:01,790 --> 01:43:04,380
Sheriff Briscoe says it's a fantasy.

1059
01:43:04,510 --> 01:43:05,820
He's wrong.

1060
01:43:06,030 --> 01:43:07,940
Saint Rose is out there...

1061
01:43:08,350 --> 01:43:09,615
...and I'm going to find it.

1062
01:43:09,715 --> 01:43:11,295
But you're the postman.

1063
01:43:11,395 --> 01:43:13,060
I'm nobody, Abby.

1064
01:43:27,390 --> 01:43:29,015
This is what I hate.

1065
01:43:29,115 --> 01:43:30,495
Strangers.

1066
01:43:30,595 --> 01:43:33,130
Do you say hi,
or do you blow their heads off?

1067
01:43:33,230 --> 01:43:35,900
Do they want to share what they got
or take what you have?

1068
01:43:37,190 --> 01:43:40,780
If they want to take, how far
are you willing to go to stop them?

1069
01:43:41,790 --> 01:43:43,620
All right, that's far enough.

1070
01:43:44,590 --> 01:43:46,340
We don't want any trouble.

1071
01:43:49,150 --> 01:43:50,500
Me neither, mister.

1072
01:43:52,550 --> 01:43:55,180
- What are you?
- Carrier 18...

1073
01:43:55,510 --> 01:43:57,420
...U.S. Postal Service.

1074
01:43:58,230 --> 01:44:01,060
- Got any mail?
- That's impossible.

1075
01:44:03,470 --> 01:44:05,210
Ain't you heard of The Postman?

1076
01:44:06,710 --> 01:44:07,810
No.

1077
01:44:08,390 --> 01:44:09,780
Tell us.

1078
01:44:10,470 --> 01:44:13,140
He's only the greatest man
who ever lived.

1079
01:44:13,590 --> 01:44:15,495
He crossed the wasteland...

1080
01:44:15,595 --> 01:44:17,655
...shook his fist at the enemy...

1081
01:44:17,755 --> 01:44:21,260
...and spit in the eye
of General Bethlehem himself.

1082
01:44:21,830 --> 01:44:24,700
He's back east
with President Starkey right now.

1083
01:44:25,430 --> 01:44:27,220
Who told you all this?

1084
01:44:27,630 --> 01:44:30,050
Postmaster Ford Lincoln Mercury.

1085
01:44:30,180 --> 01:44:32,655
He's in direct contact
with the Restored Congress.

1086
01:44:32,755 --> 01:44:34,580
Direct contact?!

1087
01:44:34,750 --> 01:44:35,995
I don't believe this!

1088
01:44:36,095 --> 01:44:37,530
Carrier camp!

1089
01:44:37,630 --> 01:44:39,170
Carrier camp!

1090
01:44:39,270 --> 01:44:40,790
Gather around, everybody!

1091
01:44:40,890 --> 01:44:43,500
Come on, gather around.
Got another letter here.

1092
01:44:44,710 --> 01:44:46,340
It came in last night.

1093
01:44:49,510 --> 01:44:52,815
- What's all this?
- The Postman sent Ford another letter.

1094
01:44:52,915 --> 01:44:54,610
He's going to read it.

1095
01:44:56,230 --> 01:44:57,980
<i>"Hello, all postal carriers.</i>

1096
01:44:58,350 --> 01:45:00,340
<i>Hello.</i>

1097
01:45:02,510 --> 01:45:05,495
<i>I'm here in Minneapolis</i>
<i>with President Starkey...</i>

1098
01:45:05,595 --> 01:45:07,540
<i>...but my thoughts are with you.</i>

1099
01:45:07,750 --> 01:45:08,830
<i>Remember...</i>

1100
01:45:08,930 --> 01:45:11,730
<i>...nothing worth doing</i>
<i>can be done overnight.</i>

1101
01:45:11,830 --> 01:45:15,615
<i>Keep your chins up</i>
<i>and do your best not to get shot.</i>

1102
01:45:15,715 --> 01:45:18,220
<i>Signed The Postman"!</i>

1103
01:45:21,710 --> 01:45:24,220
His letters are always kind of short.

1104
01:45:25,190 --> 01:45:26,660
Hold on!
There's a P.S.

1105
01:45:27,950 --> 01:45:30,660
Does anybody know
what P.S. stands for?

1106
01:45:45,870 --> 01:45:48,860
- Holy shit!
- That would be H.S., Eddie.

1107
01:45:49,830 --> 01:45:52,895
No, I saw him once
when I lived in Pineview.

1108
01:45:52,995 --> 01:45:54,380
It's The Postman.

1109
01:46:12,750 --> 01:46:14,580
All right.

1110
01:46:25,630 --> 01:46:27,540
Guess you want to talk about this.

1111
01:46:37,990 --> 01:46:39,900
I found him!
I found him!

1112
01:46:45,590 --> 01:46:47,220
<i>"Minneapolis?"</i>

1113
01:46:47,590 --> 01:46:50,740
<i>"P.S. Ford knows what to do?"</i>

1114
01:46:51,910 --> 01:46:53,260
What is this?

1115
01:46:53,590 --> 01:46:55,715
What is all this?
What the hell...

1116
01:46:55,815 --> 01:46:57,130
I lied!

1117
01:46:57,230 --> 01:47:00,370
I told people you were
in direct contact with me.

1118
01:47:02,470 --> 01:47:05,780
- Why?
- Because I didn't want it to end.

1119
01:47:08,630 --> 01:47:09,820
Look...

1120
01:47:10,430 --> 01:47:14,055
...I don't know how long I can stay.
I mean...

1121
01:47:14,155 --> 01:47:15,695
...President Starkey...

1122
01:47:15,795 --> 01:47:20,380
...he's going to send word for me
one day and then I'll have to move on.

1123
01:47:21,310 --> 01:47:22,900
Do you understand?

1124
01:47:24,110 --> 01:47:26,570
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

1125
01:47:28,710 --> 01:47:29,770
Good.

1126
01:47:29,870 --> 01:47:32,820
But you'll stay
until he sends word, right?

1127
01:47:43,430 --> 01:47:44,980
Don't do that.
Hands down.

1128
01:47:46,620 --> 01:47:49,460
You're staying till
President Starkey sends word, right?

1129
01:47:49,830 --> 01:47:50,910
Yes.

1130
01:47:51,010 --> 01:47:52,940
Until he sends word. Right.

1131
01:47:53,990 --> 01:47:57,300
Could you say a few words
just so they know it's really you?

1132
01:48:02,710 --> 01:48:04,100
It's me.

1133
01:48:21,830 --> 01:48:23,340
Coming down.

1134
01:48:26,710 --> 01:48:29,060
We bring all the mail here first.

1135
01:48:29,670 --> 01:48:31,015
We sort it.

1136
01:48:31,115 --> 01:48:33,330
We group it.
Then it goes out.

1137
01:48:33,830 --> 01:48:36,180
<i>So far, we got '50 routes.</i>

1138
01:48:46,430 --> 01:48:48,500
You spelled "tyranny" wrong.

1139
01:48:50,150 --> 01:48:51,460
Boy!

1140
01:48:51,910 --> 01:48:53,540
He's smart.

1141
01:48:54,550 --> 01:48:57,355
<i>- From the swift completion...</i>
<i>- From the swift completion...</i>

1142
01:48:57,455 --> 01:49:00,010
<i>- ...of their appointed rounds.</i>
<i>- ...of their appointed rounds.</i>

1143
01:49:01,390 --> 01:49:04,690
Congratulations.
You are now U.S. postal carriers.

1144
01:49:16,990 --> 01:49:18,290
How old are you?

1145
01:49:18,910 --> 01:49:20,850
I'm 68, sir.

1146
01:49:24,020 --> 01:49:27,060
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

1147
01:49:28,670 --> 01:49:30,055
Can you ride?

1148
01:49:30,155 --> 01:49:31,210
No.

1149
01:49:31,310 --> 01:49:33,140
Can't walk too good either.

1150
01:49:33,790 --> 01:49:35,660
So why are you here?

1151
01:49:36,070 --> 01:49:37,740
I know stuff.

1152
01:49:38,300 --> 01:49:40,180
"Know stuff."

1153
01:49:43,190 --> 01:49:44,660
Where did you get that?

1154
01:49:47,830 --> 01:49:49,597
1970.

1155
01:49:50,950 --> 01:49:53,375
A girl with eyes as big as saucers...

1156
01:49:53,475 --> 01:49:56,020
...did me in a little town
called Saigon.

1157
01:50:00,070 --> 01:50:01,170
Okay.

1158
01:50:08,470 --> 01:50:10,100
Abby.

1159
01:50:12,910 --> 01:50:16,620
- Yeah?
- Ford wants me to have his place.

1160
01:50:17,630 --> 01:50:18,860
Said it's the best.

1161
01:50:22,630 --> 01:50:23,900
I'm on the other side.

1162
01:50:27,110 --> 01:50:29,180
I got plenty of room here.

1163
01:50:33,950 --> 01:50:36,580
So much for the uniform theory.

1164
01:50:43,430 --> 01:50:45,580
He was captured on the Oregon border.

1165
01:50:47,670 --> 01:50:49,535
Who the hell are you?

1166
01:50:49,635 --> 01:50:51,340
Carrier 12.

1167
01:50:51,910 --> 01:50:53,500
United States Postal Service.

1168
01:51:08,070 --> 01:51:10,940
I want the camp struck at dawn.

1169
01:51:13,590 --> 01:51:15,060
We'll be moving north!

1170
01:51:20,470 --> 01:51:22,900
You spelled "tyranny" wrong.

1171
01:51:26,150 --> 01:51:27,860
I wish they'd stop saluting.

1172
01:51:36,910 --> 01:51:38,380
Just stay safe.

1173
01:51:39,430 --> 01:51:40,820
Remember...

1174
01:51:41,270 --> 01:51:43,300
...the mailman's more important
than the mail.

1175
01:51:44,950 --> 01:51:46,700
Boy, he's smart.

1176
01:51:50,670 --> 01:51:53,860
When I was a kid we used to turn
our hat around backwards.

1177
01:51:55,150 --> 01:51:57,060
Thought it was cool.

1178
01:52:03,190 --> 01:52:05,500
- Yah!
- Jesus Christ!

1179
01:52:14,940 --> 01:52:16,060
Damn!

1180
01:53:21,630 --> 01:53:22,730
I missed him.

1181
01:55:08,070 --> 01:55:10,170
What's the name of this town?

1182
01:55:12,390 --> 01:55:13,930
We never named it.

1183
01:55:16,180 --> 01:55:17,890
I officially declare...

1184
01:55:17,990 --> 01:55:20,180
...Postal Station Number 10...

1185
01:55:21,100 --> 01:55:22,610
...in Elvis, Oregon...

1186
01:55:22,710 --> 01:55:24,420
...open for business.

1187
01:55:27,070 --> 01:55:31,050
From now on you got to get your mail
down there, okay?

1188
01:55:31,830 --> 01:55:33,580
This one doesn't work.

1189
01:55:44,980 --> 01:55:46,460
Read it again.

1190
01:55:47,150 --> 01:55:48,370
Are you sure?

1191
01:55:48,470 --> 01:55:49,620
Yes.

1192
01:55:51,110 --> 01:55:53,730
<i>"Dearest Mom:</i>
<i>What a miracle to hear from you."</i>

1193
01:55:59,740 --> 01:56:01,780
Stuff is getting better.

1194
01:56:02,150 --> 01:56:04,580
Stuff is getting better every day.

1195
01:56:08,380 --> 01:56:09,650
I don't know who you are...

1196
01:56:12,190 --> 01:56:14,570
...but I do know
I was wrong about you.

1197
01:56:19,110 --> 01:56:21,260
Got a letter for you too, sheriff.

1198
01:56:34,030 --> 01:56:35,860
It's from my sister.

1199
01:56:37,180 --> 01:56:38,690
Thought she was dead.

1200
01:56:40,310 --> 01:56:41,780
You thought wrong.

1201
01:57:01,910 --> 01:57:04,020
Would you like to dance?

1202
01:57:08,870 --> 01:57:11,060
<i>~ Well, they say that you can never ~</i>

1203
01:57:13,260 --> 01:57:14,940
<i>~ Never go back home ~</i>

1204
01:57:20,310 --> 01:57:22,490
<i>~ And if you're bound to wander ~</i>

1205
01:57:25,350 --> 01:57:27,370

<i>~ When I look into your eyes ~</i>

1209
01:57:41,870 --> 01:57:43,180
Want to dance?

1210

Hello.

1232
01:59:24,990 --> 01:59:26,220
Hello.

1233
01:59:26,390 --> 01:59:28,180
Who do you talk to?

1234
01:59:28,340 --> 01:59:31,300
Not a soul in seven years of trying...

1235
01:59:31,430 --> 01:59:32,820
...but I will.

1236
01:59:36,590 --> 01:59:37,810
Want some?

1237
01:59:37,910 --> 01:59:39,540
No, thanks.

1238
01:59:40,030 --> 01:59:42,420
Don't let the kids see that.

1239
01:59:42,620 --> 01:59:44,340
You go ahead, take a look.

1240
01:59:45,030 --> 01:59:47,500
I was an aerospace engineer.

1241
01:59:47,750 --> 01:59:50,930
I helped design
the Galileo Space Station.

1242
01:59:51,230 --> 01:59:52,330
No shit?

1243
01:59:52,430 --> 01:59:53,700
No shit.

1244
01:59:54,470 --> 01:59:57,540
I dream it's orbiting
the Earth forever...

1245
01:59:58,190 --> 01:59:59,900
...with a dozen human skeletons...

1246
02:00:00,630 --> 02:00:02,340
...all grinning at each other...

1247
02:00:02,950 --> 02:00:04,820
...laughing at us down here.

1248
02:00:15,910 --> 02:00:18,060
- What is it?
- It's Tony.

1249
02:00:18,430 --> 02:00:19,860
He's overdue.

1250
02:00:21,830 --> 02:00:23,380
That makes five.

1251
02:00:24,270 --> 02:00:26,260
All on southern routes.

1252
02:00:26,630 --> 02:00:29,730
No.No.No.

1253
02:00:32,310 --> 02:00:34,100
Just children.

1254
02:00:34,620 --> 02:00:36,500
You bring me children.

1255
02:00:36,830 --> 02:00:39,650
- I want a man.
- Sir?

1256
02:00:42,950 --> 02:00:44,770
We got births and...

1257
02:00:44,870 --> 02:00:46,055
...deaths.

1258
02:00:46,155 --> 02:00:48,620
Got weather.
Mostly gossip.

1259
02:00:48,830 --> 02:00:50,410
There's nothing here.

1260
02:00:50,710 --> 02:00:52,050
Nothing?

1261
02:00:52,790 --> 02:00:54,130
Everything...

1262
02:00:54,230 --> 02:00:55,620
...is here.

1263
02:00:56,470 --> 02:00:59,900
Am I the only one who sees that?!

1264
02:01:00,190 --> 02:01:01,300
What?

1265
02:01:10,470 --> 02:01:13,330
A military man,
especially a commander...

1266
02:01:13,430 --> 02:01:14,900
...should keep a journal.

1267
02:01:15,110 --> 02:01:17,275
After he's gone,
it's the only real defense...

1268
02:01:17,375 --> 02:01:20,340
...against the slander
that later arises.

1269
02:01:44,350 --> 02:01:46,570
Tell me about the other stuff you know.

1270
02:02:38,670 --> 02:02:39,770
Shit!

1271
02:04:20,550 --> 02:04:21,980
Get rid of the bodies.

1272
02:04:22,900 --> 02:04:25,700
I don't want these people blamed
for what we did.

1273
02:04:27,910 --> 02:04:30,790
<i>Neither snow, nor rain,</i>
<i>nor gloom of night</i>

1274
02:04:30,890 --> 02:04:33,030
<i>Neither snow, nor rain,</i>
<i>nor gloom of night</i>

1275
02:04:33,130 --> 02:04:35,230
<i>Through bandit's hell,</i>
<i>through firefight</i>

1276
02:04:35,330 --> 02:04:37,315
<i>Through bandit's hell,</i>
<i>through firefight</i>

1277
02:04:37,415 --> 02:04:39,590
<i>Through flood and plague</i>
<i>we cannot fail</i>

1278
02:04:39,690 --> 02:04:41,470
<i>Through flood and plague</i>
<i>we cannot fail</i>

1279
02:04:41,570 --> 02:04:43,875
<i>No Holnist trash</i>
<i>will stop the mail.</i>

1280
02:04:43,975 --> 02:04:46,260
<i>No Holnist trash</i>
<i>will stop the mail.</i>

1281
02:04:46,540 --> 02:04:48,860
You are now U.S. Postal carriers.

1282
02:04:49,750 --> 02:04:51,355
Congratulations.

1283
02:04:51,455 --> 02:04:52,970
They changed the oath.

1284
02:04:53,510 --> 02:04:54,660
Ford's idea.

1285
02:04:55,430 --> 02:04:56,690
Figures.

1286
02:04:57,510 --> 02:04:59,990
They don't think to ask
who they're replacing...

1287
02:05:00,090 --> 02:05:01,300
...or why.

1288
02:05:02,070 --> 02:05:03,290
Sir?

1289
02:05:06,310 --> 02:05:08,690
It'd be an honor
if I could shake your hand.

1290
02:05:10,790 --> 02:05:12,700
Do I know you?

1291
02:05:14,230 --> 02:05:15,740
I don't think so.

1292
02:05:18,350 --> 02:05:19,500
Good luck, then.

1293
02:05:28,830 --> 02:05:30,170
Nice kid.

1294
02:05:30,790 --> 02:05:32,895
He'll probably be dead in a week.

1295
02:05:32,995 --> 02:05:35,180
Now that is not your fault.

1296
02:05:35,430 --> 02:05:38,110
You're exhausted. You need rest.
There's food...

1297
02:05:38,210 --> 02:05:39,380
Hey.

1298
02:05:40,550 --> 02:05:42,460
- Where are you going?
- Route 22.

1299
02:05:42,910 --> 02:05:45,170
You're grounded.
Get off the horse.

1300
02:05:45,990 --> 02:05:48,010
- You know the rule.
- What rule?

1301
02:05:49,270 --> 02:05:51,490
22, it's too far south.
Get off the horse.

1302
02:05:51,590 --> 02:05:53,015
But they're waiting on...

1303
02:05:53,115 --> 02:05:54,770
Get off the goddamn horse!

1304
02:05:57,020 --> 02:05:58,900
I'll tie him off to this one.

1305
02:05:59,190 --> 02:06:00,700
You can't keep doing this!

1306
02:06:01,510 --> 02:06:03,210
- Doing what?
- Riding all the routes.

1307
02:06:03,310 --> 02:06:05,260
You're not saving anybody.

1308
02:06:06,990 --> 02:06:10,010
Did I ever tell you
how I got to be a postman?

1309
02:06:11,710 --> 02:06:13,490
I don't know if you'd laugh
or cry.

1310
02:06:18,630 --> 02:06:19,810
What is it?

1311
02:06:20,950 --> 02:06:22,380
- I don't know.
- Watch out!

1312
02:06:29,710 --> 02:06:31,260
We got fire! Move!

1313
02:07:05,310 --> 02:07:07,980
- "Postage due."
- Elvis patrol.

1314
02:07:13,030 --> 02:07:14,780
You want a war?

1315
02:07:16,230 --> 02:07:18,300
You want a war?!

1316
02:07:18,790 --> 02:07:20,470
I'll give you...

1317
02:07:20,570 --> 02:07:22,420
...a war!

1318
02:07:23,110 --> 02:07:24,535
I was...

1319
02:07:24,635 --> 02:07:27,050
...born for it!

1320
02:07:27,860 --> 02:07:29,540
You murderers!

1321
02:07:31,910 --> 02:07:33,740
You think you can ride?!

1322
02:07:35,110 --> 02:07:37,460
Then today's your lucky day!

1323
02:07:38,070 --> 02:07:39,690
<i>Bethlehem says...</i>

1324
02:07:40,390 --> 02:07:41,980
<i>...he's headed north.</i>

1325
02:07:43,100 --> 02:07:45,495
<i>He's going to kill 10 people</i>
<i>in every town...</i>

1326
02:07:45,595 --> 02:07:48,060
<i>...then burn it to the ground</i>
<i>for what you did.</i>

1327
02:07:49,630 --> 02:07:51,850
<i>He said that Pineview's on his way.</i>

1328
02:07:53,270 --> 02:07:55,370
He'd wait there for you,
but not for long.

1329
02:07:57,430 --> 02:07:59,330
I was so scared, sir.

1330
02:07:59,550 --> 02:08:01,930
I thought
they were going to kill me too.

1331
02:08:08,830 --> 02:08:12,010
See? We're too late. I told you.

1332
02:08:12,310 --> 02:08:13,735
What are you going to do?

1333
02:08:13,835 --> 02:08:15,380
I'm going to stop this.

1334
02:08:15,860 --> 02:08:19,135
- You can't.
- Get out of the way, Ford. All of you!

1335
02:08:19,235 --> 02:08:20,470
They'll kill you!

1336
02:08:20,570 --> 02:08:22,730
Goddamn it. Get out!

1337
02:08:24,230 --> 02:08:25,330
Hold him!

1338
02:08:26,390 --> 02:08:28,315
You still have time!

1339
02:08:28,415 --> 02:08:30,050
Stop it!

1340
02:08:30,790 --> 02:08:31,975
- You're hurting him!
- I'm not!

1341
02:08:32,075 --> 02:08:33,102
Yes, you are!

1342
02:08:33,202 --> 02:08:35,540
I'm not!
I'm not hurting him.

1343
02:08:36,310 --> 02:08:40,180
This is all my doing.
I went against your orders.

1344
02:08:40,830 --> 02:08:44,530
You told me to bury the dead Holnists,
but I sent them Bethlehem.

1345
02:08:44,630 --> 02:08:45,730
Why?

1346
02:08:45,950 --> 02:08:47,320
Bethlehem has to know
we won't stop!

1347
02:08:47,590 --> 02:08:49,420
Goddamn it, Ford!

1348
02:08:50,710 --> 02:08:53,170
Those people are dying because of us!

1349
02:08:53,270 --> 02:08:55,565
They're dying because of what we did.

1350
02:08:55,665 --> 02:08:58,215
They're not!
They're dying because of Bethlehem...

1351
02:08:58,315 --> 02:09:01,370
...because this is a shitty world!
If we're going to change it...

1352
02:09:01,470 --> 02:09:03,175
...then someone might have to die.

1353
02:09:03,275 --> 02:09:06,020
If I could make it be me down there,
I would, but I can't!

1354
02:09:09,190 --> 02:09:10,580
No! Please!

1355
02:09:12,830 --> 02:09:14,290
- You, out here!
- Hold her!

1356
02:09:14,390 --> 02:09:15,820
Please!

1357
02:09:32,070 --> 02:09:34,100
He's out there somewhere.

1358
02:09:35,670 --> 02:09:36,970
Watching.

1359
02:09:39,190 --> 02:09:41,020
I can feel it.

1360
02:09:44,140 --> 02:09:46,020
You feel it too, don't you?

1361
02:09:47,420 --> 02:09:49,780
It didn't have to end
like this, sheriff!

1362
02:09:50,150 --> 02:09:53,940
He knew where I'd be
if he wanted to face me like a man!

1363
02:09:54,550 --> 02:09:56,170
Instead he's hiding...

1364
02:09:56,270 --> 02:09:57,700
...like a rabbit!

1365
02:09:58,030 --> 02:10:00,060
So much for your Postman!

1366
02:10:00,710 --> 02:10:02,050
Lieutenant!

1367
02:10:02,750 --> 02:10:03,850
Ready!

1368
02:10:05,070 --> 02:10:06,690
We don't even know their names.

1369
02:10:07,750 --> 02:10:09,460
We know their names.

1370
02:10:14,310 --> 02:10:15,410
I think that's my dad.

1371
02:10:24,180 --> 02:10:25,380
Aim!

1372
02:10:26,060 --> 02:10:27,420
Ride, Postman!

1373
02:10:27,910 --> 02:10:29,260
Ride!

1374
02:10:29,510 --> 02:10:30,775
You hear me?!

1375
02:10:30,875 --> 02:10:32,780
I said, ride!

1376
02:10:33,910 --> 02:10:35,010
Fire!

1377
02:10:57,660 --> 02:10:59,780
My God, what have I done?

1378
02:11:02,580 --> 02:11:04,290
What Ford did was wrong!

1379
02:11:07,910 --> 02:11:10,010
But it doesn't change anything...

1380
02:11:10,110 --> 02:11:13,300
...for any of us, does it?

1381
02:11:35,110 --> 02:11:36,370
Is this everybody?

1382
02:11:37,350 --> 02:11:38,820
The rest are on the overdue list.

1383
02:11:40,150 --> 02:11:41,770
Then this is everybody.

1384
02:11:42,790 --> 02:11:44,980
Got a letter from the president.

1385
02:11:47,190 --> 02:11:48,850
<i>"Greetings, all carriers."</i>

1386
02:11:48,950 --> 02:11:50,650
Greetings, President Starkey!

1387
02:11:54,630 --> 02:11:57,135
<i>"I've been in contact with The Postman.</i>

1388
02:11:57,235 --> 02:11:59,060
<i>And I've received all the reports.</i>

1389
02:11:59,500 --> 02:12:01,210
<i>I'm proud of you all.</i>

1390
02:12:02,030 --> 02:12:04,090
<i>In dark days,</i>
<i>in a weary world...</i>

1391
02:12:04,190 --> 02:12:06,660
<i>...you gave everything</i>
<i>and asked for nothing.</i>

1392
02:12:07,590 --> 02:12:10,090
<i>You beat back despair</i>
<i>and replaced it with hope.</i>

1393
02:12:10,740 --> 02:12:13,130
<i>For that, your country</i>
<i>can never repay you.</i>

1394
02:12:13,870 --> 02:12:15,460
<i>But the price is too high...</i>

1395
02:12:17,020 --> 02:12:20,170
<i>...and I won't see any more</i>
<i>of my bravest die.</i>

1396
02:12:21,550 --> 02:12:24,130
<i>It is my duty to hereby disband...</i>

1397
02:12:24,230 --> 02:12:27,620
<i>...the Postal Service</i>
<i>of the Restored United States.</i>

1398
02:12:28,350 --> 02:12:30,450
<i>You are to burn your uniforms...</i>

1399
02:12:30,550 --> 02:12:34,010
<i>...and The Postman</i>
<i>is to return to Minneapolis at once.</i>

1400
02:12:34,670 --> 02:12:36,130
<i>Thank you.</i>

1401
02:12:36,630 --> 02:12:38,300
<i>And God bless you all.</i>

1402
02:12:39,110 --> 02:12:40,330
<i>The President."</i>

1403
02:12:57,230 --> 02:12:59,490
The president never wrote that letter.

1404
02:12:59,900 --> 02:13:02,180
If he could've,
that's what he would have said.

1405
02:13:02,350 --> 02:13:04,150
Who's the other letter to?

1406
02:13:04,250 --> 02:13:05,540
Bethlehem.

1407
02:13:05,910 --> 02:13:08,340
- I'm taking it to him in the morning.
- What's it say?

1408
02:13:08,750 --> 02:13:11,690
- Mail's private, you know that.
- What does it say?

1409
02:13:12,980 --> 02:13:14,730
It says it's over.

1410
02:13:14,990 --> 02:13:16,780
It says we quit.

1411
02:13:17,030 --> 02:13:19,690
No, I'! Says you quit!

1412
02:13:20,230 --> 02:13:21,375
What about the oath?

1413
02:13:21,475 --> 02:13:23,210
Tell me something, Ford.

1414
02:13:23,310 --> 02:13:26,300
How much mail
can a dead postman deliver?

1415
02:13:27,350 --> 02:13:28,740
It's over.

1416
02:13:33,380 --> 02:13:36,620
- Then I'll take it.
- No. I can't trust you.

1417
02:13:44,270 --> 02:13:46,060
If this is the end...

1418
02:13:47,590 --> 02:13:50,660
...if this is the last piece of mail
that ever gets delivered...

1419
02:13:53,020 --> 02:13:54,570
...I'll take it.

1420
02:13:56,340 --> 02:13:59,580
Whoever delivers this letter, Ford,
probably dies for it.

1421
02:13:59,910 --> 02:14:02,050
I'm still a postman!

1422
02:14:05,150 --> 02:14:06,250
You owe it to me.

1423
02:14:07,870 --> 02:14:08,970
I owe it to me.

1424
02:14:24,030 --> 02:14:25,780
<i>It's not Ford's fault.</i>

1425
02:14:26,190 --> 02:14:29,930
<i>He's not like you. He doesn't have</i>
<i>your memories. None of them do.</i>

1426
02:14:30,950 --> 02:14:32,660
<i>This is all they have.</i>

1427
02:14:33,340 --> 02:14:35,810
- It's the only decent thing they know.
- What?

1428
02:14:35,910 --> 02:14:37,340
Being a postman?

1429
02:14:38,700 --> 02:14:40,535
It's all bullshit, Abby.

1430
02:14:40,635 --> 02:14:41,850
All of it.

1431
02:14:42,590 --> 02:14:45,500
I took the uniform off a skeleton
to stay warm.

1432
02:14:45,740 --> 02:14:48,580
I made up the rest to stay fed.

1433
02:14:49,020 --> 02:14:50,250
There is no...

1434
02:14:50,350 --> 02:14:52,980
...Restored United States.

1435
02:14:53,750 --> 02:14:55,510
I figured it was something like that.

1436
02:14:55,610 --> 02:14:57,590
I'm going to Saint Rose.

1437
02:14:57,690 --> 02:14:59,540
I'm taking you with me.

1438
02:15:00,220 --> 02:15:02,140
I've already packed your horse.

1439
02:15:02,910 --> 02:15:05,050
I know you don't want to hear it...

1440
02:15:05,670 --> 02:15:08,020
...but that's my child inside you.

1441
02:15:08,710 --> 02:15:10,780
I want to see it born somewhere safe.

1442
02:15:33,310 --> 02:15:35,180
I thought I recognized you.

1443
02:15:35,910 --> 02:15:39,010
General Bethlehem said you should be
on your knees when I do this.

1444
02:15:39,310 --> 02:15:41,260
I don't give a damn
what that asshole said.

1445
02:15:42,230 --> 02:15:43,980
The general is a great man!

1446
02:15:48,220 --> 02:15:50,500
The general is a fucking lunatic.

1447
02:15:55,550 --> 02:15:57,140
You want to see a man?

1448
02:15:58,030 --> 02:15:59,500
That's a man.

1449
02:16:03,390 --> 02:16:04,530
You ready?

1450
02:16:08,590 --> 02:16:09,820
Yes.

1451
02:16:13,190 --> 02:16:15,490
You're a better man than Bethlehem.

1452
02:16:16,390 --> 02:16:17,780
I've seen it.

1453
02:16:22,470 --> 02:16:23,660
<i>"To Bethlehem.</i>

1454
02:16:24,470 --> 02:16:26,460
<i>This letter is my testimony...</i>

1455
02:16:26,950 --> 02:16:29,370
<i>...to the fact that there is no...</i>

1456
02:16:29,470 --> 02:16:31,650
<i>...Restored United States...</i>

1457
02:16:31,830 --> 02:16:34,060
<i>...and there is no postal service."</i>

1458
02:16:35,510 --> 02:16:38,100
- He expects me to believe this?
- It's true, sir.

1459
02:16:42,300 --> 02:16:44,530
I was there.
He disbanded the carriers...

1460
02:16:45,670 --> 02:16:48,250
- ...and rode west.
- Traitor!

1461
02:16:50,950 --> 02:16:52,050
Then I've won.

1462
02:16:58,550 --> 02:17:00,980
Bring the one we found yesterday.
They can die together.

1463
02:17:02,110 --> 02:17:03,490
You traitor!
You're a traitor!

1464
02:17:08,270 --> 02:17:09,500
Sir.

1465
02:17:10,310 --> 02:17:12,370
That one's the second-in-command.

1466
02:17:12,470 --> 02:17:14,700
Why doesn't that surprise me?

1467
02:17:17,940 --> 02:17:19,500
I was thinking, sir...

1468
02:17:20,870 --> 02:17:23,850
...he might be more valuable to us
as a prisoner.

1469
02:17:24,940 --> 02:17:27,035
You were supposed to kill him...

1470
02:17:27,135 --> 02:17:28,330
...weren't you?

1471
02:17:29,550 --> 02:17:31,420
I couldn't get close enough.

1472
02:17:51,620 --> 02:17:52,820
Who are you?

1473
02:17:53,670 --> 02:17:55,355
My name's Clark.

1474
02:17:55,455 --> 02:17:58,250
Postal Carrier
for the Restored Republic of California.

1475
02:17:58,750 --> 02:18:00,580
- Who are you?
- Ready!

1476
02:18:05,700 --> 02:18:08,260
Postmaster Ford Lincoln Mercury.

1477
02:18:10,070 --> 02:18:11,170
Aim!

1478
02:18:16,430 --> 02:18:17,780
It's an honor.

1479
02:18:21,030 --> 02:18:22,130
Wait!

1480
02:18:24,030 --> 02:18:26,170
Wait a minute.
Hold your fire.

1481
02:18:30,940 --> 02:18:32,540
You two don't know each other?

1482
02:18:38,700 --> 02:18:39,800
No.

1483
02:18:40,430 --> 02:18:42,660
This'll never be over.

1484
02:18:43,110 --> 02:18:44,650
It'll go on.

1485
02:18:46,070 --> 02:18:48,610
Except I'll be fighting
a goddamn ghost.

1486
02:18:49,430 --> 02:18:52,020
- Should we fire, sir?
- No, goddamn it!

1487
02:18:53,310 --> 02:18:55,060
I won't fight a ghost.

1488
02:18:57,390 --> 02:18:58,780
<i>Tabula...</i>

1489
02:18:59,300 --> 02:19:00,655
<i>rasa...</i>

1490
02:19:00,755 --> 02:19:02,100
...gentlemen.

1491
02:19:02,910 --> 02:19:04,810
A clean slate.

1492
02:19:05,620 --> 02:19:08,620
I want all mail carriers hunted down.

1493
02:19:09,310 --> 02:19:11,735
I want The Postman found.

1494
02:19:11,835 --> 02:19:13,780
I want him dealt with.

1495
02:19:14,540 --> 02:19:16,290
Colonel, organize the scouts.

1496
02:19:17,910 --> 02:19:20,490
- You said he rode west?
- Yes, sir.

1497
02:19:24,310 --> 02:19:26,220
And this is his second-in-command?

1498
02:19:29,980 --> 02:19:31,210
Yes, sir!

1499
02:19:43,870 --> 02:19:47,100
I'll keep you to bargain with.
The Postman is weak that way.

1500
02:20:35,510 --> 02:20:37,460
Set your rifle on the ground!

1501
02:20:38,100 --> 02:20:40,020
Set it on the ground.

1502
02:20:41,470 --> 02:20:43,610
What? This old thing?

1503
02:20:45,070 --> 02:20:46,260
It isn't even loaded.

1504
02:20:47,430 --> 02:20:48,970
Where are we?

1505
02:20:49,910 --> 02:20:51,900
You're in Bridge City...

1506
02:20:53,670 --> 02:20:55,700
...where we don't allow guns.

1507
02:21:05,710 --> 02:21:07,490
The sentry said you were coming.

1508
02:21:15,030 --> 02:21:17,050
I know you. You're...

1509
02:21:17,310 --> 02:21:18,410
...famous.

1510
02:21:19,950 --> 02:21:21,435
I was once...

1511
02:21:21,535 --> 02:21:22,855
...sort of...

1512
02:21:22,955 --> 02:21:24,260
...kind of.

1513
02:21:24,430 --> 02:21:25,900
Not anymore.

1514
02:21:26,670 --> 02:21:29,620
- Looking to cross?
- We will be.

1515
02:21:30,390 --> 02:21:33,300
Right now we'd appreciate some food.

1516
02:21:34,910 --> 02:21:36,250
Okay.

1517
02:21:37,030 --> 02:21:38,555
There are some kids behind us.

1518
02:21:38,655 --> 02:21:40,660
- How many?
- Three.

1519
02:21:41,430 --> 02:21:43,290
Genius. Okay.

1520
02:21:46,110 --> 02:21:47,820
Come on in, guys!

1521
02:21:49,980 --> 02:21:52,060
I know you're out there.

1522
02:23:00,870 --> 02:23:03,100
- Wait. Just wait.
- What did he want?

1523
02:23:04,700 --> 02:23:06,535
Hold on. He says...

1524
02:23:06,635 --> 02:23:08,820
...he's looking for The Postman.

1525
02:23:09,230 --> 02:23:11,300
There's no such thing anymore.

1526
02:23:14,740 --> 02:23:17,580
The man on the horse says there is.

1527
02:23:17,990 --> 02:23:19,860
He thinks he's here.

1528
02:23:20,140 --> 02:23:22,300
And he's coming back with friends.

1529
02:23:27,380 --> 02:23:29,330
What's a postman?

1530
02:23:46,340 --> 02:23:47,780
You never heard of a postman?

1531
02:24:23,790 --> 02:24:24,980
Are you The Postman?

1532
02:24:30,430 --> 02:24:31,540
Yeah.

1533
02:24:32,830 --> 02:24:34,580
I heard of you, man.

1534
02:24:35,350 --> 02:24:36,810
You're famous.

1535
02:24:38,630 --> 02:24:40,380
Yeah, I guess I am.

1536
02:24:41,910 --> 02:24:43,700
And all of a sudden,
I'm not...

1537
02:24:44,070 --> 02:24:46,060
...wearing the right clothes.

1538
02:24:59,860 --> 02:25:02,130
Man, you're going to love this!

1539
02:25:02,430 --> 02:25:05,130
Open that second chute, bro!

1540
02:25:20,940 --> 02:25:23,220
You have a gift, Postman.

1541
02:25:24,670 --> 02:25:27,060
I saw it back in Pineview.

1542
02:25:29,350 --> 02:25:32,180
You've given us all back
what we'd forgotten.

1543
02:25:33,910 --> 02:25:36,930
You made Mrs. March feel like
she could see again.

1544
02:25:38,470 --> 02:25:42,060
You made Ford feel like
he was part of the world.

1545
02:25:44,750 --> 02:25:47,195
You give out hope like it was...

1546
02:25:47,295 --> 02:25:49,300
...candy in your pocket.

1547
02:26:04,630 --> 02:26:06,050
Remember this?

1548
02:26:07,580 --> 02:26:09,050
I remember.

1549
02:26:10,470 --> 02:26:13,340
I always like to think
that you left it on purpose.

1550
02:26:18,670 --> 02:26:20,730
This is hard for me.

1551
02:26:24,860 --> 02:26:27,980
Michael was the best man I ever knew.

1552
02:26:30,460 --> 02:26:34,020
I never thought there'd be another man
I could love the way I loved him.

1553
02:26:37,630 --> 02:26:40,300
I couldn't see it for so long.

1554
02:26:42,700 --> 02:26:44,580
And now you're leaving.

1555
02:26:48,780 --> 02:26:49,980
And I'm afraid.

1556
02:26:53,310 --> 02:26:55,850
I'm afraid you'll never
find your Saint Rose.

1557
02:26:56,500 --> 02:27:00,260
- It's not important.
- I'm afraid you'll never see your baby.

1558
02:27:27,230 --> 02:27:31,010
I need full power, man!
This dude's got a long way to go!

1559
02:27:31,580 --> 02:27:32,680
Whoa!

1560
02:27:35,580 --> 02:27:37,700
This thing's working perfect, man!

1561
02:27:49,030 --> 02:27:51,100
A lot higher than it looks, huh?

1562
02:27:53,030 --> 02:27:54,170
Whoa!

1563
02:27:54,630 --> 02:27:56,010
Hey!

1564
02:28:00,620 --> 02:28:02,100
You nearly went.

1565
02:28:04,380 --> 02:28:05,480
Get in.

1566
02:28:06,940 --> 02:28:09,590
There's three good-sized towns up ahead...

1567
02:28:09,690 --> 02:28:13,260
...with enough people to help you
if you can convince them to come.

1568
02:28:16,540 --> 02:28:18,325
Don't tell anybody...

1569
02:28:18,425 --> 02:28:21,650
...I like to ride this damn thing
just for the hell of it.

1570
02:28:21,750 --> 02:28:24,980
Being a city official
has its perks, you know?

1571
02:28:32,550 --> 02:28:36,260
Trust me, man.
This'll get you there a lot faster.

1572
02:28:36,830 --> 02:28:38,010
Okay.

1573
02:28:41,510 --> 02:28:42,780
How do I stop?

1574
02:28:43,150 --> 02:28:45,430
Quit worrying about the little things.

1575
02:28:45,530 --> 02:28:47,530
Good luck, and Godspeed.

1576
02:29:02,940 --> 02:29:05,055
<i>Reporting for duty, sir!</i>

1577
02:29:05,155 --> 02:29:07,000
<i>- Know what to do?</i>
<i>- Talk to the people.</i>

1578
02:29:07,230 --> 02:29:08,630
<i>Tell them it's important.</i>

1579
02:29:08,730 --> 02:29:10,090
<i>Tell them we can make a difference.</i>

1580
02:29:11,030 --> 02:29:14,490
<i>"Once more unto the breach,</i>
<i>dear friends, once more...</i>

1581
02:29:14,590 --> 02:29:16,940
<i>...or close the wall with our dead!</i>

1582
02:29:17,180 --> 02:29:21,130
<i>In peace, nothing so becomes a man</i>
<i>as modesty and humility.</i>

1583
02:29:21,230 --> 02:29:24,015
<i>But when the blast of war</i>
<i>blows in our ears...</i>

1584
02:29:24,115 --> 02:29:26,245
<i>...then imitate</i>
<i>the action of the tiger.</i>

1585
02:29:26,345 --> 02:29:30,575
<i>Summon up the blood.</i>
<i>Disguise fair nature with rage...</i>

1586
02:29:30,675 --> 02:29:33,820
<i>...and lend the eye</i>
<i>a terrible aspect."</i>

1587
02:30:15,430 --> 02:30:16,950
- Who are they?
- I don't know.

1588
02:30:17,050 --> 02:30:20,150
Looks like mostly women
and young people to me.

1589
02:30:20,250 --> 02:30:21,450
How many?

1590
02:30:21,750 --> 02:30:23,050
It's an army.

1591
02:30:33,340 --> 02:30:34,900
At last...

1592
02:30:35,070 --> 02:30:38,570
...someone with courage enough
to bring the fight to me.

1593
02:30:42,790 --> 02:30:44,340
Reckoning, gentlemen!

1594
02:31:35,750 --> 02:31:37,980
They're an eager-looking bunch!

1595
02:32:04,620 --> 02:32:07,380
Morale is a dangerous thing.

1596
02:32:09,190 --> 02:32:11,050
Bring up the prisoner!

1597
02:32:11,550 --> 02:32:13,460
We'll show them
how this game is played.

1598
02:32:54,110 --> 02:32:55,460
Stay here.

1599
02:33:09,350 --> 02:33:10,450
Is he surrendering?

1600
02:33:10,790 --> 02:33:12,540
God, I hope not.

1601
02:33:33,430 --> 02:33:35,090
My little shipping clerk.

1602
02:33:35,590 --> 02:33:37,450
Mr. copy-machine salesman.

1603
02:33:38,540 --> 02:33:40,420
We're both a couple of frauds.

1604
02:33:42,500 --> 02:33:43,860
So be it.

1605
02:33:45,030 --> 02:33:48,580
But great men are made
by other great men.

1606
02:33:49,020 --> 02:33:50,380
Patton had Rommel.

1607
02:33:50,830 --> 02:33:52,890
Grant had Lee.

1608
02:33:53,500 --> 02:33:56,610
- But I get you.
- You're no general.

1609
02:33:57,550 --> 02:33:59,010
You're not even a good painter.

1610
02:34:01,260 --> 02:34:02,895
Trying to goad me
into a fight?

1611
02:34:02,995 --> 02:34:06,660
It'd be great if wars were fought
just by the assholes who started them.

1612
02:34:08,310 --> 02:34:09,860
We could settle this right here...

1613
02:34:10,950 --> 02:34:12,260
...you and me.

1614
02:34:14,060 --> 02:34:16,150
Unfortunately,
it doesn't work that way.

1615
02:34:16,250 --> 02:34:18,060
But it does in your army.

1616
02:34:18,870 --> 02:34:20,940
I invoke Law Seven...

1617
02:34:21,470 --> 02:34:22,610
...of the Laws of Eight!

1618
02:34:24,470 --> 02:34:27,990
"Any man may challenge
for leadership of the clan!"

1619
02:34:28,090 --> 02:34:29,370
- What?
- I challenge you.

1620
02:34:29,470 --> 02:34:33,690
You're not a Holnist. You're not
a member. You don't have the right.

1621
02:34:33,790 --> 02:34:35,620
I have every right!

1622
02:34:41,190 --> 02:34:42,620
I invoke Law Seven.

1623
02:34:43,910 --> 02:34:45,770
Where do I...?

1624
02:35:07,220 --> 02:35:08,525
I challenge...

1625
02:35:08,625 --> 02:35:10,405
...for leadership of the clan!

1626
02:35:10,505 --> 02:35:12,180
Where do I know you from?

1627
02:35:12,860 --> 02:35:14,460
<i>"Cry havoc...</i>

1628
02:35:14,740 --> 02:35:16,860
<i>...and let slip the dogs of war!"</i>

1629
02:35:17,870 --> 02:35:19,050
You remember that?

1630
02:35:21,340 --> 02:35:22,740
Shakespeare.

1631
02:35:23,380 --> 02:35:25,610
The one who didn't want to fight.

1632
02:35:26,150 --> 02:35:29,700
I should have found a way to kill you
then, but you seemed so strong.

1633
02:35:31,270 --> 02:35:32,540
Law Seven...

1634
02:35:33,700 --> 02:35:34,930
...it is!

1635
02:35:35,910 --> 02:35:37,860
This war is settled here!

1636
02:37:01,260 --> 02:37:02,970
I studied people.

1637
02:37:04,270 --> 02:37:06,250
I know your problem.

1638
02:37:06,790 --> 02:37:08,095
Do you know...

1639
02:37:08,195 --> 02:37:10,250
...why you can't fight?

1640
02:37:12,230 --> 02:37:15,450
Because you have nothing
to fight for.

1641
02:37:17,940 --> 02:37:19,940
You don't care about anything.

1642
02:37:20,870 --> 02:37:23,540
You don't value anything.

1643
02:37:23,870 --> 02:37:26,575
You don't believe in anything!

1644
02:37:26,675 --> 02:37:28,810
And that's what makes me better.

1645
02:37:30,950 --> 02:37:32,380
I believe...

1646
02:37:32,990 --> 02:37:35,090
...in the United States.

1647
02:38:10,310 --> 02:38:11,410
No.

1648
02:38:13,030 --> 02:38:15,940
It doesn't have to be this way.

1649
02:38:16,700 --> 02:38:18,980
We don't have to kill each other.

1650
02:38:21,140 --> 02:38:22,740
"Law Three:

1651
02:38:23,260 --> 02:38:24,530
Mercy...

1652
02:38:24,830 --> 02:38:26,370
...is for the weak."

1653
02:38:26,470 --> 02:38:28,050
Ford, don't!

1654
02:38:28,230 --> 02:38:29,650
"Law Eight:

1655
02:38:29,950 --> 02:38:32,340
There's only one penalty...

1656
02:38:33,020 --> 02:38:35,250
...and that penalty is death."

1657
02:38:40,710 --> 02:38:42,290
He isn't worth it.

1658
02:38:45,790 --> 02:38:47,860
I'm the head of the clan now!

1659
02:38:49,830 --> 02:38:51,610
There are going to be new laws!

1660
02:38:52,910 --> 02:38:54,340
Law One:

1661
02:38:55,950 --> 02:38:57,460
No more killing.

1662
02:38:58,230 --> 02:39:00,330
There's going to be peace!

1663
02:39:06,820 --> 02:39:08,254
Yes.

1664
02:39:17,390 --> 02:39:19,420
How about it, Ford Lincoln Mercury?

1665
02:39:25,390 --> 02:39:26,770
Be a leader, Ford.

1666
02:39:29,870 --> 02:39:31,380
Law Eight:

1667
02:39:36,060 --> 02:39:37,435
Live...

1668
02:39:37,535 --> 02:39:39,140
...and let live.

1669
02:39:49,180 --> 02:39:50,280
Yeah.

1670
02:39:50,470 --> 02:39:51,980
Yeah.

1671
02:41:00,060 --> 02:41:01,975
Your daddy wrote to tell you...

1672
02:41:02,075 --> 02:41:04,775
...he'll be here as soon as he can...

1673
02:41:04,875 --> 02:41:07,410
...and that he loves you very much.

1674
02:41:14,950 --> 02:41:16,410
Mail's slow.

1675
02:41:17,830 --> 02:41:19,850
I'm going to have to see about that.

1676
02:41:50,790 --> 02:41:52,340
Your daughter.

1677
02:41:54,310 --> 02:41:56,410
Her name is Hope.

1678
02:42:25,820 --> 02:42:28,310
My father saw how fragile we are...

1679
02:42:28,410 --> 02:42:31,380
...and how quickly we fell
into the hands of tyranny.

1680
02:42:32,430 --> 02:42:34,235
He saw that ordinary men...

1681
02:42:34,335 --> 02:42:37,610
...could reach deep within themselves
and find courage.

1682
02:42:37,830 --> 02:42:41,455
He saw that if we began to communicate
as a nation...

1683
02:42:41,555 --> 02:42:43,485
...we could become strong again...

1684
02:42:43,585 --> 02:42:44,890
...united.

1685
02:42:45,500 --> 02:42:47,850
But he never did see Saint Rose.

1686
02:42:49,260 --> 02:42:50,660
He said...

1687
02:42:51,190 --> 02:42:53,220
...there was too much to be done.

1688
02:42:54,670 --> 02:42:56,220
He'd made a promise.

1689
02:42:56,630 --> 02:42:59,740
And in keeping it,
he traded one dream for another.

1690
02:43:00,220 --> 02:43:01,860
With no regrets.

1691
02:43:05,140 --> 02:43:07,530
And so, in honor of my father...

1692
02:43:44,700 --> 02:43:46,410
That was me.
