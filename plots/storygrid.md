Empty book = fill in the blanks within genre conventions (sci-fi | factualism !)  
  
know character's actions along with them from characterization (but not ahead, keep to the present moment like IRL or in meditation)  
(Promise of the Premise is when they act as usual in a new situation and fail to change)

the story naturally happens to a person in a location given enough specific detail

character represents theme metaphorically and is rationally the best entity to represent it by a set of qualities - 'silent as a fish, dull as a lawyer'  
clarify the subject but never attempt to know the theme from the start (killjoy and spoiler)
