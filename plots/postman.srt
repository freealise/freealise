Watching.

1447
02:15:11,770 --> 02:15:13,562
I can feel it.

1448
02:15:16,942 --> 02:15:18,776
You feel it too, don't you?

1449
02:15:20,362 --> 02:15:22,696
It didn't have to end
like this, sheriff!

1450
02:15:23,198 --> 02:15:27,034
He knew where I'd be
if he wanted to face me like a man!

1451
02:15:27,786 --> 02:15:29,370
Instead he's hiding...

1452
02:15:29,579 --> 02:15:30,955
...like a rabbit!

1453
02:15:31,414 --> 02:15:33,415
So much for your Postman!

1454
02:15:34,209 --> 02:15:35,501
Lieutenant!

1455
02:15:36,336 --> 02:15:37,336
Ready!

1456
02:15:38,755 --> 02:15:40,339
We don't even know their names.

1457
02:15:41,550 --> 02:15:43,217
We know their names.

1458
02:15:48,390 --> 02:15:49,390
I think that's my dad.

1459
02:15:58,692 --> 02:15:59,817
Aim!

1460
02:16:00,652 --> 02:16:01,944
Ride, Postman!

1461
02:16:02,571 --> 02:16:03,863
Ride!

1462
02:16:04,239 --> 02:16:05,447
You hear me?!

1463
02:16:05,657 --> 02:16:07,533
I said, ride!

1464
02:16:08,827 --> 02:16:09,827
Fire!

1465
02:16:33,602 --> 02:16:35,686
My God, what have I done?

1466
02:16:38,732 --> 02:16:40,399
What Ford did was wrong!

1467
02:16:44,279 --> 02:16:46,363
But it doesn't change anything...

1468
02:16:46,573 --> 02:16:49,783
...for any of us, does it?

1469
02:17:12,641 --> 02:17:13,849
Is this everybody?

1470
02:17:14,976 --> 02:17:16,393
The rest are on the overdue list.

1471
02:17:17,896 --> 02:17:19,480
Then this is everybody.

1472
02:17:20,649 --> 02:17:22,816
Got a letter from the president.

1473
02:17:25,237 --> 02:17:26,862
"Greetings, all carriers."

1474
02:17:27,072 --> 02:17:28,739
CROWD:
Greetings, President Starkey!

1475
02:17:32,994 --> 02:17:35,496
"I've been in contact with The Postman.

1476
02:17:35,705 --> 02:17:37,498
And I've received all the reports.

1477
02:17:38,083 --> 02:17:39,750
I'm proud of you all.

1478
02:17:40,710 --> 02:17:42,753
In dark days,
in a weary world...

1479
02:17:42,963 --> 02:17:45,422
...you gave everything
and asked for nothing.

1480
02:17:46,508 --> 02:17:49,009
You beat back despair
and replaced it with hope.

1481
02:17:49,803 --> 02:17:52,179
For that, your country
can never repay you.

1482
02:17:53,056 --> 02:17:54,598
But the price is too high...

1483
02:17:56,351 --> 02:17:59,520
...and I won't see any more
of my bravest die.

1484
02:18:01,064 --> 02:18:03,649
It is my duty to hereby disband...

1485
02:18:03,858 --> 02:18:07,278
...the Postal Service
of the Restored United States.

1486
02:18:08,154 --> 02:18:10,239
You are to burn your uniforms...

1487
02:18:10,448 --> 02:18:13,951
...and The Postman
is to return to Minneapolis at once.

1488
02:18:14,744 --> 02:18:16,161
Thank you.

1489
02:18:16,788 --> 02:18:18,414
And God bless you all.

1490
02:18:19,374 --> 02:18:20,541
The President."

1491
02:18:38,268 --> 02:18:40,519
The president never wrote that letter.

1492
02:18:41,062 --> 02:18:43,314
If he could've,
that's what he would have said.

1493
02:18:43,606 --> 02:18:45,399
Who's the other letter to?

1494
02:18:45,567 --> 02:18:46,817
Bethlehem.

1495
02:18:47,319 --> 02:18:49,737
- I'm taking it to him in the morning.
- What's it say?

1496
02:18:50,280 --> 02:18:53,240
- Mail's private, you know that.
- What does it say?

1497
02:18:54,701 --> 02:18:56,410
It says it's over.

1498
02:18:56,786 --> 02:18:58,537
It says we quit.

1499
02:18:58,913 --> 02:19:01,582
No, it says you quit!

1500
02:19:02,250 --> 02:19:03,334
What about the oath?

1501
02:19:03,543 --> 02:19:05,252
Tell me something, Ford.

1502
02:19:05,462 --> 02:19:08,464
How much mail
can a dead postman deliver?

1503
02:19:09,674 --> 02:19:11,008
It's over.

1504
02:19:15,972 --> 02:19:19,224
- Then I'll take it.
- No. I can't trust you.

1505
02:19:27,317 --> 02:19:29,068
If this is the end...

1506
02:19:30,779 --> 02:19:33,864
...if this is the last piece of mail
that ever gets delivered...

1507
02:19:36,451 --> 02:19:37,951
...l'll take it.

1508
02:19:39,913 --> 02:19:43,165
Whoever delivers this letter, Ford,
probably dies for it.

1509
02:19:43,625 --> 02:19:45,751
I'm still a postman!

1510
02:19:49,089 --> 02:19:50,089
You owe it to me.

1511
02:19:51,925 --> 02:19:52,925
I owe it to me.

1512
02:20:08,775 --> 02:20:10,484
ABBY:
It's not Ford's fault.

1513
02:20:11,027 --> 02:20:14,822
He's not like you. He doesn't have
your memories. None of them do.

1514
02:20:15,990 --> 02:20:17,658
This is all they have.

1515
02:20:18,493 --> 02:20:20,953
- It's the only decent thing they know.
- What?

1516
02:20:21,162 --> 02:20:22,538
Being a postman?

1517
02:20:24,082 --> 02:20:25,874
It's all bullshit, Abby.

1518
02:20:26,084 --> 02:20:27,251
All of it.

1519
02:20:28,128 --> 02:20:31,046
I took the uniform off a skeleton
to stay warm.

1520
02:20:31,423 --> 02:20:34,258
I made up the rest to stay fed.

1521
02:20:34,843 --> 02:20:36,009
There is no...

1522
02:20:36,219 --> 02:20:38,846
...Restored United States.

1523
02:20:39,764 --> 02:20:41,515
I figured it was something like that.

1524
02:20:41,683 --> 02:20:43,684
I'm going to Saint Rose.

1525
02:20:43,852 --> 02:20:45,686
I'm taking you with me.

1526
02:20:46,521 --> 02:20:48,397
I've already packed your horse.

1527
02:20:49,315 --> 02:20:51,442
I know you don't want to hear it...

1528
02:20:52,193 --> 02:20:54,528
...but that's my child inside you.

1529
02:20:55,363 --> 02:20:57,406
I want to see it born somewhere safe.

1530
02:21:21,014 --> 02:21:22,848
I thought I recognized you.

1531
02:21:23,725 --> 02:21:26,852
General Bethlehem said you should be
on your knees when I do this.

1532
02:21:27,270 --> 02:21:29,188
I don't give a damn
what that asshole said.

1533
02:21:30,315 --> 02:21:32,024
The general is a great man!

1534
02:21:36,571 --> 02:21:38,822
The general is a fucking lunatic.

1535
02:21:44,204 --> 02:21:45,746
You want to see a man?

1536
02:21:46,789 --> 02:21:48,207
That's a man.

1537
02:21:52,378 --> 02:21:53,462
You ready?

1538
02:21:57,800 --> 02:21:58,967
Yes.

1539
02:22:02,597 --> 02:22:04,890
You're a better man than Bethlehem.

1540
02:22:05,934 --> 02:22:07,267
I've seen it.

1541
02:22:12,273 --> 02:22:13,398

"To Bethlehem.

1542

LUKE: It's true, sir.

1547
02:22:32,961 --> 02:22:35,170
I was there.
He disbanded the carriers...

1548
02:22:36,464 --> 02:22:39,049
...and rode west.
- Traitor!

1549
02:22:41,970 --> 02:22:42,970

Sir.

1553
02:23:02,156 --> 02:23:04,199
That one's the second-in-command.

1554
02:23:04,409 --> 02:23:06,618
Why doesn't that surprise me?

1555
02:23:10,123 --> 02:23:11,623
I was thinking, sir...

1556
02:23:13,167 --> 02:23:16,169
...he might be more valuable to us
as a prisoner.

1557
02:23:17,422 --> 02:23:19,506
You were supposed to kill him...

1558
02:23:19,674 --> 02:23:20,841
...werert you?

1559
02:23:22,218 --> 02:23:24,052
I couldn't get close enough.

No.

02:24:38,920 --> 02:24:40,420
It'll go on.

a goddamn ghost.

02:24:45,510 --> 02:24:48,095
- Should we fire, sir?
- No, goddamn it!

1575
02:24:49,555 --> 02:24:51,264
I won't fight a ghost.

- Yes, sir.
