### The Lost DJ

The Last DJ and Postman are the same story (villain is the next Pope as a comedy dictator = personality cult)  
happening around Europe (as too far to the left for America, like Sanders) - DJ laid off in Britain gets a station in Georgia  
'new wave' (not a genre but direct revelation), post-cyberpunk (retrofuturism, disappointment with tech - 'nowpunk')

"...the world of creative arts throughout Europe following the Enlightenment—from music, to art, 
to literature and film—was known for pushing, rather than preserving, social and moral boundaries, 
introducing new voices and ideas that challenged the prevailing establishment. 
For hundreds of years, the secular arts were known for confronting and mocking traditional beliefs 
and ways of life, all in the name of uninhibited exploration." 🥀

'The mass of people and sound was reminiscent of film footage of 1930s Nuremberg rallies. 
According to author Keith Badman, this prompted Lennon to give a Nazi salute "and shout 'Sieg Heil!', 
even holding his finger to his upper lip as a Hitler-style moustache". 
Lennon also took to giving crowds an open-palmed benediction in the style of the Pope.'
(reason: disappointment with Christianity)
