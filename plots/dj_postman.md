### The Lost DJ (Kabbalah)
  
is the story of Abulafia who thought himself the Moshiach,  
and the Arizal who interpreted the idea behind the Zohar  
transferred to the present moment for all the gentiles  
  
The Last DJ and Postman are the same story set in foreseeable future (TP as main character - both DJ and mayor, villain is the next Pope as a comedy dictator = personality cult,

happening around Europe (as too far to the left for America, like Sanders) - DJ laid off in Britain gets a station in Georgia  
'new wave' (not a genre but direct revelation), post-cyberpunk (retrofuturism, disappointment with tech - 'nowpunk')

"a play that is worth producing, produces itself"  

"Driven not by money but popularity (?), an unfortunate DJ goes against the corporate culture and ethic, 
only instead is broke and confused - and only the truth will save him"

"...the world of creative arts throughout Europe following the Enlightenment‚Äîfrom music, to art, 
to literature and film‚Äîwas known for pushing, rather than preserving, social and moral boundaries, 
introducing new voices and ideas that challenged the prevailing establishment. 
For hundreds of years, the secular arts were known for confronting and mocking traditional beliefs 
and ways of life, all in the name of uninhibited exploration." ü•Ä

'The mass of people and sound was reminiscent of film footage of 1930s Nuremberg rallies. 
According to author Keith Badman, this prompted Lennon to give a Nazi salute "and shout 'Sieg Heil!', 
even holding his finger to his upper lip as a Hitler-style moustache". 
During the group's years on the Hamburg club circuit, Lennon had taken to giving mock-Hitler tirades 
from the stage and baiting audiences with jokes about Germany's loss in World War II.
Lennon also took to giving crowds an open-palmed benediction in the style of the Pope.'

He told me that if it hadn't been for the Night Watchman, he might have had to give up writing. He had exhausted all his own stories. For weeks he cudgelled his brain in vain. Then suddenly in desperation he seized his pen and wrote:
"Speaking of wimmen," said the Night Watchman.
And after that, it was plain sailing. He left it to the Night Watchman. The Night Watchman talked on.
