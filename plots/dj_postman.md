### The Lost DJ

The Last DJ and Postman are the same story (villain is the next Pope as a comedy dictator = personality cult)  
happening around Europe (as too far to the left for America, like Sanders) - TP is British  
parody 'new wave' (retrofuturism), post-cyberpunk (disappointment with tech - 'nowpunk')
