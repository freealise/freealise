The Roma were musicians and dancers as well as circus performers that moved place to place, having an adventurous nomadic lifestyle, away from society's conventional norms and expectations. This lifestyle inspired [...] the hippie movement of the 1950s and 1960s in the United States.  
Most Roma are Christian, but many are Muslims; some retained their ancient faith of Hinduism from their original homeland of India [...]. Theravada Buddhism influenced by the Dalit Buddhist movement have become popular in recent times among Hungarian Roma.
