face movement with mocap

normals from depth map in opencv (https://answers.opencv.org/question/82453/calculate-surface-normals-from-depth-image-using-neighboring-pixels-cross-product/)  
foil -> mocap for auto quality feedback ?

//depth map in alpha - edit manually ? (geometrize along with color, gradient)  
  
//scene frames with depth for focus by pov and depth map (opencv):  
//divide image into 256 layers by depth color mask and blur each with its kernel size
