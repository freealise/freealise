lightgl for antarctic panoramas with depth map / parallax and doodling on skybox (+in ar (opencv): pencil is point and normal / color)  
combine spheres by csg and load several panoramas with depth map, show pixels from them in space as points  
similarly, several photos / video frames of tinfoil (or ar doodles) with depth combined to show in 3d (~averia)  
  
load skeleton from raster lines of varying depth and width (opencv sparse optical flow) -> csg
