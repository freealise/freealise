face movement with mocap  
scene with color and shadows (filmed or drawn cubemap + layers / transparency) -> 3d video  
normals from depth map in opencv (https://answers.opencv.org/question/82453/calculate-surface-normals-from-depth-image-using-neighboring-pixels-cross-product/)  
foil -> mocap for auto quality feedback ?

//upload video/subs to archive.org for transcoding (https://archive.org/details/download_20240209_0047)  
  
//correct depth map by algorithm  
//combine several timepoints in 3d for inpainting / animation (delete objects that changed position - or by segmentation? - and add them from video)  
//use hs(l) color from combined changed objects for grayscale filmed video and remove background, keeping shadows  
//color by hand and use upscaler for closeups
